            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing requeſted by a friend of mine to put downe in writing, the manner, and way how to rule and order his <hi>Hawke,</hi> after hee had drawne her out of the mewe: And to make her ready, and fit to be flown. I conſider red with my ſelfe, that it would not bee much, more labour, or amiſſe for me (huuing ſome ſpare and idle time to ſpend) euen to begin with her firſt, as ſhe is wilde, liuing in the aire. And although it hath been affirmed, that the waies and coaſts of birds, and foules of the aire, are altogether vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and not to be diſtinguiſhed in certaine: yet doe not I take it to be meant, nor ſpoken generally, of all ſorts, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of ſuch as liue and abide neere men, and little feare the ſight or conuerſation of men. for they care not, neithrr co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet to be conſtant in their flight, nor ſecure when they doe reſt, but euen as it happeneth, ſo are they in ſafety. And becauſe the <hi>Haggard faulcon</hi> is the birde, and hawke, that (in theſe daies) moſt men doe couet and deſire to prepare, and make fit for their pleaſure.

               <p>I haue already ſpoken of her chiefeſt phiſicke, as ſhe is wilde, which is the labour of her body, and the exerciſe of her wings: Now will I ſhew you what ſhee actually addeth to the former for the preſeruation, &amp; continuance of her health.</p>
               <p>When ſhe hath ſlaine and ſeiſed on her pray, if it be a doue, ſo ſoone as ſhe hath broken the necke, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhe goes vnto that place which we abhor our hawkes ſhould ſo much as touch, which is the croppe, and thereof ſhe taketh her pleaſure, and of that which is within it, as eſpecially of the Muſtard ſeede, or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, which ſoeuer it be, and of this ſhe will not faile to to caſt great ſtore in her caſting euery morning vnder her ſtand.

When ſhe hath well fed, and filled her gorge and body full of meate: ſhe leaueth that place, and flieth vnto ſome ſolitary and ſecret place, where ſhe ſitteth all the day in the aire, and hath the water and what ſhe liketh to benefit her ſelfe withall. When night drawes neere away ſhe flies vnto the place where ſecrely within her ſelfe ſhe hath purpoſed and appointed beefore to reſt all night.</p>
               <p>And thus omitting to ſpeake any more of her in the kinde of her wildeneſſe, I will now according to the order and method vſed by my ſelfe in mine owne practiſe, ſhewe how to reclaime, and make her ſubiect to the man.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen you doe take one of theſe Hawkes, or ſhall haue one of them newly taken &amp; brought to your handes, moſt commonly heere in England their bodies will be full of meate, then is it beſt after her taking (aſſoone as you may) to ſet her downe, and let her ſit where ſhe may reſt quietly for the firſt night, either ſeeled, or in a rufter hood: ſo ſhall you preuent many dangers, that might otherwiſe enſue, as the frounce; or ſurfeting on heate. Likewiſe if ſhee be taken when ſhe is empty, it is your beſt courſe to vſe her as before, for they are vpon ſuch occaſion ſubiect to anger and fretting, and therof may the like imperfections grow, the next day eaſily take her vpon your fiſt gently, and ceaſe not to carry her the whole day continually, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a feather in ſteede of your hand to touch and ſtroake her withall, and when you finde her gentle and willing to be toucht without ſtarting:<note place="margin">A feather is more gentle then your hand, &amp; ſhe wil endure it better. Vuhood her firſt in the morning.</note> then may you alone by your ſelfe pull off her hood, and quicly, and gently put it one againe, holding this courſe vntill ſhe begin to feede: then you muſt proffer her meate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſuffering her to take but a little at once, euen to pleaſe her withall, neuer pulling of her hood, nor put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it one without a bit or two, both before and after, to quiet her, and drawe her loue vnto the hood and your ſelfe, not forgetting to vſe your voice vnto her, before you take it off, and all the while ſhe is a feeding
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8778:17"/>
and no longer: that as ſhee reclaimeth, and her ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke groweth or encreaſeth, ſhe may learne to know that when ſhe heareth your voice, ſhe ſhall bee fed. Then, when through your diligent paines, and this preſcribed order in your practiſe you haue brought her to feede boldly: then will it be fit time to teach her to iumpe to your fiſt, which you muſt doe in this manner.</p>
               <p>Set her downe vpon a pearch, about your breſt high, or otherwiſe if it be a low pearch, then you muſt bee on your knees, becauſe your <hi>Haggard</hi> will bee fearefull, and ready to ſtart and bate from you, when ſhee ſhall ſee you ſo high ouer her at the firſt, vntill ſhe bee better acquainted with you. Then vnſtrike her hood, and lure her vſing your voice, with a bitte or two of meate beſtowed on her as ſhee is hoodded, for that wil make her eager, and to loue your voice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee ſees nothing to croſſe that humor in her: whereas otherwiſe it may be as yet her coyneſſe, or her perceiuing of one thing or other may prouoke her to take diſlike, or to bate from you, and thereby catch ſome ſodaine feare,<note n="*" place="margin">A good ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat.</note> which at the firſt you ought to be carefull to preuent, for it is hard to worke that out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, which ſhe is ſuffered to take at the firſt, and moſt commonly ſhe will be ſubiect to it euer after, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or euill. Therefore it ſhall be your beſt courſe to hold this order, vntill you ſhall finde her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, and her ſtomacke perfect: for it is that onely that guides and rules her,<note place="margin">The ſtomack</note> it is the curbe and bridle that holds and keepes her in ſubiection to the man, &amp; it is the ſpurre that pricketh her forwarde to perform the duty ſhe oweth to her keeper, and that which hee requireth from her to be effected: and without that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8778:17"/>
one only thing bee preſerued and carefully kept ripe perfect, ſharpe, and truely edged, there is no ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be gained; nor no content to be receiued:<note n="*" place="margin">No ſubiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when the ſtomacke is full.</note> but ſcornefull diſobedience, and alltogether offenſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Now by this time you may be bould to pull of her hood, and let her ſit bare faced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> keeping your ſelfe as as yet cloſe by her: and as you ſhall perceiue her to haue any vntoward humor in her, (as to ſtare about, or wry her ſelfe to and fro) profer her a bit of meate with your hand, and vſe your voice withall to drawe her ſtraight vnto you, which when you haue effected, and that you doe finde ſhe will boldly attend, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue bits at your hand, and iump readily to your fiſt: Then will it be a fit time to ſet her to the lure: which order and practiſe (becauſe I know the ſimpleſt Faulconer is not ignorant of) I will omit.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, ſo ſoone as your hawke wil com re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely in the creyance to the lure garniſht with meate, ſtay not long in that kinde, for ſhe will ſoone beginne to scorne it, and looke annother way. Then will it be conuenient to let her ſee a liue doue at the lure, and lure her vnto the ſame: which when ſhee hath killed, and eaten the head, take her vp very gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a bit of meate, and put on her hood: then lure her againe vnto the dead pelt, and ſo vſe her two or three times and no more: for ſhe will quickly begin to perceiue your intent, and will grow loath to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and her deſire to keepe it ſtill in her poſſeſſion will cauſe her to drag it from you: and thereby her loue will rather abate, then encreaſe.</p>
               <p>Often luring at one time and at her firſt entrance is good to make her perfect, and to haſten her withall:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8778:18"/>
but vſe it not longe, nor no longer then I haue direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Alſo it is worſe in a <hi>field hawke,</hi> then it is in a <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hawke,</hi> in regard (as you haue heard) it moues her to carry, which is a great fault in any hawke And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now it is full time to lure her looſe vnto liue <hi>Doues,</hi> which you muſt let her ſee at your lure to draw and haſten her to come vnto you with loue and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
               <p>Alſo you muſt let her ſeaſe vpon them and kill the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen at your foote, one after another, for halfe a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen daies togeather. being ſure he that holdes her, may haue skill to let her in with her head right towards you, and lure not far vntill her ſtomacke be perfect, &amp; her ſelfe very ready to come: for otherwiſe ſhe may eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ſomthing out of the way that ſhe hath more liking vnto, and ſo for that time be loſt, which would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hurtfull vnto her, although ſhe ſhould bee recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe.</p>
               <p>Likwiſe forget not all this time of her making (while ſhe is on the ground, either pluming or feeding to walke round about her,<note place="margin">Remember this rule.</note> vſing your voice, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her many bits with your hand: And leaue not off this courſe, but euery day vſe her vnto it, vntill you haue wonne her euen to leane and bend her body to your hand, and to bring what ſhee hath in her foote towards you-ſo far as ſhee is able, or otherwiſe to ſhew her loue and deſire vnto the ſame.</p>
               <p>By this time it will not bee amiſſe to ſpring her vp ſome liue Doues as ſhee comes vnto you, betwixt the man and the lure: and be ſure they be giuen in a long Criance, that ſhee may not kill them farre from you; but alwaies that ſhee may truſſe them ouer your head, and fall neere you; for otherwiſe it may be a ſpeciall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8778:18"/>
caue to ſtſrike a timerous conceit into her, and make her ſit and ſtare at you, and to drag and carry from you, and ſome time to leaue and forſake what ſhee hath and goe her way, when ſhee ſhal ſit and ſee you comming ſo farre from her. I haue heard of ſome Hawkes that would not be taken vp againe without ſtriking or rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the Cryance: but whenſoeuer they haue beene flowne, and not kild a fowle, they would ſurely haue beene loſt without ſuch a deuice, which is a great fault in any Hawke, &amp; it doth greatly redownd vnto the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit of the Fawlkconer, that through his default and negligence, ſhee haue caught ſuch an ill property in her firſt making, becauſe he had no more care nor skill to gouerne her aright: For there is many a one that takes in hand to keepe a Hawke, that hauing neither skill nor iudgement, doe not deſerue the true title of a Faulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Therefore beware of this one thing, which I may iuſtly terme an error in diuers keepers of Hawkes, who haue by this ouerſight ſpoiled, and vtterly vndone ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a braue Haggard.</p>

For the onelie content you can giue to thoſe kinde of hawkes, is to let them haue their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſpeedilie, before they beginne to be wearie, and while their courage is in them, and vntil they be ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in loue and blood, for there is not anie thing that puts a young hawke ſooner out of conceit with the man, or withdrawes her loue, and driues her ſooner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, then to ſuffer her to flie too long before ſhee be ſerued.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The third rule.</note>
                  <hi>There is yet a Hawke</hi> of a third diſpoſition, or qualitie, that alſo in the time of her making, hath giuen or ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed little or no cauſe of offence vnto her keeper, yet in his obſeruation hee hath perceiued her to be of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king humor, deſirous to clime, and of an aſpiring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but through his care and skill he hath kept her downe, and held her neere about him, which courſe I hold expedient to be vſed, for in my youth I learned and obſerued it, and euer ſince in my labor haue found
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8778:22"/>
the ſame to be the moſt certaine and beſt rule to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>that in the time</hi> of her making no ſcope be giuen to the <hi>Haggard,</hi> neither to flie high, nor wild, but to be held downe and neere you: For whenſoeuer <hi>ſhee</hi> ſhall come to be welblooded on Fowle, and perceiues what <hi>ſhee</hi> ſhould doe, if euer <hi>ſhee</hi> were a flier you cannot hold her downe, now when you ſhal come (according to the foreſaid manner) to let this <hi>Hawke</hi> into another hawk, you ſhall ſee her goe to her buſineſſe without euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting or looking towards the other hawke, but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon you as if <hi>ſhee</hi> were wilde, then doth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houe you to feare her, and be carefull to let her ſee fowle in due time, leaſt when <hi>ſhee</hi> comes to her wonted place, ſhee goes her way. For it is the manner of ſuch great metteld and ſelfe wild hawkes, not to abide nor tarry at the firſt no longer, then they be where they may command their pray. Therefore for ſuch a <hi>Hawke</hi> as a man ſhall find to be ſelfe conceited, not caring for nor regarding the companie of another hawke, you ought vntill <hi>ſhee</hi> be verie well quarried to be carefull, &amp; ſuffer her not to flie too long at the firſt, before you ſhew her fowle: and ſo the ſhorter worke you make with her, the greater content you giue her, and ſhall thereby win her loue vnto you for euer.</p>
               <p>With the firſt of theſe three orders, I haue reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an outragious vnſtaied hawke, and ſo beſotted her with the loue of fowle, an other hawke, and the man: that <hi>ſhee</hi> hath falne cleane from her vpwardneſſe and high flying. Inſomuch that I haue beene enforced to flie her ſingle, and kill fowle with her on eaſie places, and otherwiſe with a good ſtomack put vnto her, haue throwne her off on great waters, and amongſt manie Fowle, yea, and haue had much adoe to rowſe and ſtir

               <p>And whoſoeuer doth keep manie hawkes, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meet with ſuch a one, which if hee doth; it ſhall be meet and conuenient for them to take her from the helpe of anie other <hi>Hawke,</hi> and put her to ſeruice her ſelfe, adding to the ſame the aſſiſtance of his owne labour and sikll, with great reſpect vnto her <hi>ſtomacke,</hi> with a ſteddie and certaine hand to be held on her: For he that obſerueth not theſe things, ſhall hardlie be able to keep and gouerne his Hawke aright, as he ought to doe.</p>

The knowledge of which being once attained vnto, you muſt be very carefull to order and gouerne them according to the ſame,</p>
               <p>For example, when you ſhall finde your hawke to grow ſodenly familiar with you, and quickly, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly reclaimed and inclined vnto you: as diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to liſten and giue care to you, and to your voice, to learne ſpedily to come vnto you, and when ſhe is com to ſeeme eager and hot to ceaſe vpon that which you ſhall throw or giue vnto her, &amp; be familiar with your ſelfe, without ſtarting or ſtaring about her, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

to be coie or waiward: and when ſhee hath done your will vpon the ground cloſe by you, then to looke vp for your fiſt, &amp; willingly and redily to iump vnto the ſame.

               <p>Moſt commonly theſe louing qualities are to bee founde in your <hi>blanke Hawks,</hi> for by experience I haue euer found them to be the kindeſt and louingſt <hi>hawkes</hi> of all others: and I haue obſerued that theſe kinde of hawkes are much ſubiect to a little <hi>bot,</hi> or <hi>grubworme,</hi> which doe breede in the guts, and will appeare in her mutes, crawling from forth the ſame, then ſhrinking on a heape, and ſo they die.

               <p>There is a kinde of <hi>Hawke</hi> that you ſhall finde more ſullen and dogged of diſpoſition, not caring for you, nor your voice: but looking behinde her, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waie when ſhe ſhould be lured and come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you. This <hi>Hawke</hi> although you muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty loue her, yet muſt you take good heede how you let her vnderſtand the ſame; but deale with her accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her deſerts, looking ſtreightly vnto her: I meane in her feed, and manner of her diet: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe outwardly in your behauiour towards her, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8778:25"/>
muſt be moſt louing and gentle, although you get no more then you doe wring and extort from her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force. Therefore be ſure to leſſen her pride by orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her diet with meaſure, and reſpect vnto the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which falling-out milde and temperate, you need not feare to hold her downe, vntill you haue quarried her in ſuch ſort as is before appointed for a hawke of her condition: and ſo by degrees as you ſee her alter and amend her manners, ſo may you alter her diet, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her ſtrength with reaſonable expeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which will be quicklie gotten, if ſhe be ſound, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſonable: but if the weather ſhall fall out to be violent and froſtie, then you muſt beware and take heede how you abate much fleſh, and eſpecially how you kepe it off too long.</p>
               <p>Theſe kindes of aukeward quallities are for the moſt part found in your black and ſwarthie plumed <hi>Hawkes:</hi> for although there be many of them that be good mettelled <hi>Hawkes,</hi> and high fliers: yet are they alſo hard of ward, and very euill and vneaſie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and brought in ſubiection. Therefore the greater care muſt be had of them, and of neceſſitie a ſtraighter courſe be taken with them, then with other <hi>Hawkes,</hi> that be of a more milde and louing diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And whenſoeuer you doe flie one of theſe hawkes, and haue no good ſucceſſe in your flight faile not to take her downe vnto ſome liue thing, to draw &amp; hold her loue vnto your ſelfe: for if ſhe haue not her will and pleaſure from you, ſhe will aſſuredlie ſeeke it an other waie. Therefore it is a verie ſpeciall and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good thing when your yong <hi>Hawke</hi> hath ſtooped foule, and failed to kill, then to haue a liue fowle ready
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8778:25"/>
to take her downe withall, although it be a tame one, yet let it be as neere the colour of the wilde fowle as you can, being ſure to make it ſafe from ſtrugling or ſtriuing.</p>
               <p>There is another kinde of <hi>plumed Hawks,</hi> between a blacke &amp; a tawnie, as it were of a ſuddie colour, which be as great mettelled <hi>Hawks</hi> &amp; as ſprightfull as can flie. Alſo louing and kind of diſpoſition, if they be wel and artificiallie reclaimed and made. And theſe kindes of <hi>Hawkes,</hi> being let in with another <hi>Hawke</hi> will bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently wonne with two or three <hi>quarries:</hi> if not, and that meanes be wanting, then muſt you take the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paines with them in training to make them <hi>Hawks</hi> of themſelues, which they will quicklie be, after you haue made them to flie right and true vpon you, if you obſerue and keep this enſuing order: They muſt want no ſtrength when they haue not the aſſiſtance of an other <hi>Hawke,</hi> neither muſt their ſtomacke bee wanting to put them forward to performe their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Then muſt you take a fit howre at euening when all <hi>check</hi> be paſt, with faire weather: for fowle wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and <hi>check</hi> will breede offences diuers waies: then muſt you haue a ſmal couple of <hi>Fowle</hi> conueniently in a hollow brooke, where they may ſhroud themſelues from you, and you from them: for great waters and manie <hi>Fowle</hi> cauſe too much toile for yong <hi>Hawkes,</hi> then throw off your <hi>Hawke</hi> as neere them as poſſible you may with conuenience, that you be not enforced to drawe your <hi>Hawke</hi> on her wing too far, nor tarrie too long beefore you ſhew the <hi>Fowle</hi> vnto her: for young <hi>Hawkes</hi> muſt not be ſuffered to flie too long at the firſt, but muſt be taught &amp; brought vnto it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: then the place being for your purpoſe, if your
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8778:26"/>
                  <hi>Hawke</hi> will flie right, you may at the ſecond ſtooping ouerthrow one of them, if ſhe will come hard &amp; cloſe for ſuch a <hi>Hawke</hi> as comes with vehemencie at the firſt doth more terrifie and amaze a fowle with once comming, then another that commeth coldly and with ſmall courage ſhall doe in three or foure times. If you doe faile of your expectation, and that it bee not ſuddenlie effected, miſſe not to take her downe to a hand fowle, before ſhe hath laboured and beaten her ſelfe out too much, and therein may you pleaſe her well and giue her great content. This courſe take with her ſo long as ſhe is of her ſelfe, wanting the companie of another <hi>Hawke</hi> to helpe her, and ſo you ſhall bee ſure to hold her ſtill in loue: for there is nothing more hurtfull or diſpleaſing to a yong <hi>Hawke,</hi> then at her firſt making to ſuffer her to toile, and make manie ſtoopings before ſhe be ſerued. That breedeth diſlike and cauſeth her to flie wide and careleſlie, yea, and manie times to goe her waie in great diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>There be other kinds of plumed <hi>Hawkes,</hi> and more then as yet I haue made mention of, but whatſoeuer they be or ſhall be, I hope I haue formerlie in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, prouided, ſhewed, and plainelie expreſſed, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall order or rule for their vſage, according as they ſhall be perceiued (and through the Faulconers skill) found to be in their ſeuerall natures and diuerſitie of humors diſpoſed and inclined.</p>

Now it will not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe for mee to ſpeake ſomething concerning the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and manner of bathing and weathering your hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, wherein I will brieflie ſhew you my aduiſe and counſell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:8778:27"/>Firſt as concerning bathing of your <hi>Haggard,</hi> I my ſelfe haue had verie few that would euer bathe at all, ſo long as they haue continued with me ſound, but whenſoeuer I haue proued them barefaced abroad, hauing fitted them with a reaſonable<note n="*" place="margin">Neither ſo little as hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould prouoke them nor ſo much that ſuperfluitie ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent them.</note> gorge for the purpoſe, they would be ſo diſpleaſing to me with their vnrulineſſe and extreame bateing, that before I could conuenientlie take them to my fiſt againe, I haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued them to receiue more harme that way, then they would haue beene the better for their bathing: therefore when triall ſhall be made of anie ſuch hawke, and that you find ſhee is not diſpoſed thereunto, it ſhall be better for you to keepe her on your fiſt,<note n="*" place="margin">The aire.</note> then to wrong her to no end: for thoſe kinde of hawkes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you labour them the firſt yeere truelie in their making, and haue by your diligence wrought them to your owne content, hauing made them ſo familiar, that they will ſit abroad bare faced hard by you, when they are emptie, yet if you ſhall abſent your ſelfe for triall, you ſhall find they will be vnquiet, and ſo diſtemper themſelues, that when you ſhall appeare and come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſight againe, they will ſtriue and doe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues great harme: and ſurelie I had rather my owne hawke ſhould flie two or three flights, being emptie, then ſhee ſhould bate or ſtriue once in her leaſe, her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die being full of meat. Theſe kind of hawkes being fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for the riuer, and moſt commonlie flowne thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, are oftentimes with killing Fowle drawne into the ſame, being wetted manie times with waters and raine, likewiſe the time of yeere being winter, wholie and ſharplie inclined to cold and wet, all which are great impediments, and hindrances vnto the bathing of <hi>Haggards,</hi> and it is in vaine to offer it vnto them in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8778:27"/>
that ſeaſon; otherwiſe I haue obſerued often that after two or three mewes, and towards their declining age, through extraordinarie actions of vntimelie heates or ſurfets, they haue deſired and ſought for bathing, and growne to more quietneſſe abroad barefac't; which inclination in them will be eaſilie found and deſcried: then is it meet for you not to neglect occaſion, but when the weather will permit you ſhew her the water, if ſhee doe bath, let her drie her ſelfe abroad, if it be faire and the weather temperat, otherwiſe let her haue the aire of the fire with meaſure, and come no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad that day nor night, but ſet her vpon a verie warme pearch, and from the aire, otherwiſe it might be very hurtfull to the hawke, for indeed there would be no mixture of fire and aire both, in the drying of their hawke: for<note n="*" place="margin">The hawke that is ſound bathes ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet is ſhee hot by nature, the hawke that is not ſound baths often, being more then natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hot by reaſon of her infirmitie.</note> the one, it is naturall and kind, it drieth the feathers, tempereth and ſeaſoneth the body and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the ſame, being hot by nature, but much hotter by diſtemperature, which appeareth by the bathing of ſome,<note n="*" place="margin">The fire.</note> and is proued by the not bathing of others whereby the difference between the ſound hawke and the vnſound hawke is diſcerned. The other of neceſſity muſt needs be hurtfull, becauſe in her firſt creation it is affirmed of her and al other fowles, that their reſidence and continuall aboade was allotted them in the aire, as a place and element moſt fit and correſpondent to their naturall compoſitions: and therefore the fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their oppoſit element, cannot chuſe but bee verie hurtfull, in regard it doth not onely drie the feathers of the hawke: but alſo pierceth into the bodie, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it moſt vnnaturallie: therefore when it is vſed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neceſſity there ought great heed to be taken, as I haue ſaid before; for certainely it is neither good nor
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8778:28"/>
wholſome for your hawke, either wet or dry to receiue much heat from the fire.</p>
               <p>Thus (for breuities ſake) I omit to ſpeake anie more of bathing theſe kind of hawkes, and doe referre the ſame to euery mans particular opinion, and generallie to the iudgement of all good and auncient Faulconers, whoſe long experienc't practiſe I would not draw with in the limits of preſcription: but leaue them to vſe their owne hawkes, as they through obſeruation and iuſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall find it conuenient.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The manner how to weather your Hawke.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus hauing ſpoken ſomewhat concerning the bathing of your <hi>Haggard,</hi> I will now ſpeake ſome thing of her weathering, where you muſt note by the way that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hawkes of the * ſame kinde, are taken out of the next very young,<note place="margin">Fawlcons.</note> whereby they doe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forget their naturall dam that bred them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelues to loue, and grow fond on them or him that doe foſter or bring them vp, alſo there be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of a more baſe and baſtard kinde, that out of the ſame naure will very eaſily be brought to familiaritie with the man, not in the houſe onely, but alſo abroad, hooded or vnhooded, nay many of them will be more gentle and quiet when they are vnhooded, then when they are hooded, for if a man doe but ſtirre or ſpeake in their hearing, they will crie and bate, as though they did deſire to ſee the man: Likewiſe ſome of them being vnhooded, when they ſee the man will cowre and crie
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8778:28"/>
ſhewing thereby their exceeding fondnes and fawning loue towards him. Theſe kind of hawkes may you doe with what you will, vſing them at your pleaſure, hooded or vnhooded,<note n="*" place="margin">Marke the difference betweene the Haggard &amp; the Eyas.</note> and while ſhee is in your hand ſhee will be alwaies beſt, and moſt quiet when ſhee is full gorged, and bare faced. Theſe hawkes being vnſeaſoned in their bodies (by reaſon they are debarred not onely from the continuall benefit of the aire, but alſo from other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall courſes of feeding, flying, and the like exerciſes, which they vſe in their youth, by which they become not onely ſtrong, but alſo ſound and perfect in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,)<note n="*" place="margin">For want of the aire to coole and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh them: together with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe to keepe them in health.</note> are much ſubiect vnto heat, and therefore much addicted to weathering and bathing, and almoſt will neuer refuſe the water: which notwithſtanding you muſt not impute to their vnſoundneſſe, or euill diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her body, (although there is, and euer will be ſome of them diſeaſed) but vnto the alteration &amp; change of their nature and kind, which by their bringing vp with the man, is much different from the nature of thoſe that are nouriſhed and fed by their dam.</p>
               <p>For example,<note n="*" place="margin">The Eyas.</note> theſe kind of hawkes be all (for the moſt part) taken out of the neſt very young, euen in their downe, from whence they are put into a cloſe houſe, whereas they be alwaies fed, and familiarly brought vp by the man, vntill they be able to flie, when as the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer approaching very ſuddenly, they are continued and trained vp in the ſame, the weather being alwaies warme and temperat:<note n="*" place="margin">She knowes no other dam to feed her, nor no other means to releeue her.</note> thus are they ſtill inured to familiaritie with the man, ſo that of neceſſity they muſt be both fond and louing towards him, not knowing from whence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides to fetch their reliefe or ſuſtenance. When the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is ended they be commonly put vp into a houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, or els kept in ſome warme place, for they cannot
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8778:29"/>
endure the cold wind to blow vpon them, which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of education or bringing vp, doth make them to differ much in the naturall inclination of their bodies, from the <hi>Haggard,</hi> who as you ſhall heare is foſtred after another faſhion, therefore you may boldly ſet abroad theſe Hawkes vnhooded, as well to take the aire, (the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit whereof cannot chooſe but giue a cooling comfort to their ſupernaturall imbred heats) but alſo in regard of their<note n="*" place="margin">Which is bred with them.</note> innated familiarity they will take no occaſion to bate or ſtriue, thereby to hurt themſelues when they are full gorged. But leauing to ſpeake any more of theſe kind of ſcratching Hawkes, that I did neuer loue ſhould come too neere my fingers, and to returne vnto the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and faire conditioned <hi>Haggard Faulcon,</hi> whoſe gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſpoſition I know not how to extoll, or praiſe ſo ſufficiently as ſhee deſerues.</p>
               <p>Shee for the moſt part Eyrees and breeds on the tops of high rocks in the cold aire, where ſhee continues for a time, neuer ſetting eye nor ſeeing anie man, but there is nouriſhed and brought vp by her naturall Dam, vntill ſuch time as her feathers be at home,<note place="margin">Becauſe they ſhould no longer deuoure her pray, which ſhee takes great paines to get, ſhee beates them away, or leads them into ſome ſtrange country and looſeth them</note> her ioints &amp; body ſtrong, and able to reare her ſelfe from the ſtones and mountaines into the aire, where ſhee is entertained and tutured by her dam, and by her trained vp, and taught the way to pray for her ſelfe, which when the young ones haue learned, ſhee ſuffereth them to abide no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in that coaſt: but rebuketh and chaſeth them out of that countrey, or els leadeth them her ſelfe into this or ſome other Countrey, (as we dailie ſee by experience) and there ſhee departeth from them. From that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they liue and continue wild, being forced to ſhift for themſelues, by getting their liuing with their owne labour, which they doe continually both in wet and dry
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8778:29"/>
taſting and enduring of all times &amp; ſeaſons, calmes and ſtormes, their bodies being tempered and ſeaſoned, with all ſorts and changes of wind and weather.</p>
               <p>Now muſt it needes bee that theſe kindes of <hi>Hawkes</hi> haue, and euermore will haue ſome wildneſſe in them, which diſpoſition, although I haue formerly ſhewd you how to alter and change, and to keepe them louing and familiar with you: yet that being wrought &amp; effected by art you muſt beware that nature do not get the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand, or beare the greateſt ſwaie, for if it doe, then your skill failes you, and your art deſerues no commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
               <p>Therefore when you ſhall determine to frame your <hi>Haggard</hi> to the faſhion and forme of your other hawkes (of which I haue already made mention) It will not be ſoe ſuddenly nor eaſily effected, as (it may be) you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect: for if you deſire to ſet her abroade vnhooded to weather her, as you doe your <hi>Eias,</hi> it will not be: for your <hi>Eias</hi> may be ſet abroade at any time of the daie,<note place="margin">The Eias.</note> yea and the better when her gorge is full: but as for your <hi>Haggard,</hi> you muſt take another courſe with her, for if you entende to weather her, you muſt do it in the morning, or elſe in the euening before ſhe be fed: alſo you muſt remaine cloſe by her, with meate cleane, &amp; readie dreſt to take her to your fiſt withall: otherwiſe no ſooner is her appetite ſufficed with meate, but ſhe being abroade vnhoodded ſodainly forgets al her former ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, and fales to ſtriuing and bating to be gone, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſhe will bee moſt earneſt and vnrulie when after you haue been abſent ſhe ſhall ſee you come ſodenlie vnto her, which temeritie and wilde behauiour ſhewes, (for the time) your art is abandoned, conſidering ſhee had rather doe her ſelfe a miſchiefe by bating and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8778:30"/>
then ſhe would willingly come into your hands againe. Now who for pittie to hurt and wrong this poore, louing, and kinde <hi>Bird,</hi> would ſet her abroad vnhooded, and alone by her ſelfe, knowing that nature hath a ſuperioritie and working in her aboue art, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſhe may be otherwiſe ſafely preſerued, kept, and well weathered in her hood; which courſe I would wiſh all <hi>Faulconers</hi> to take in weathering their <hi>Haggards:</hi> for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe deſires no more but what ſhe is vſed vnto, her ſtanding hooded can doe her no harme, but is rather a meanes to preuent her bating &amp; ſtriuing by which her ſpirit and courage is taken awaie, with which in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhe ſhould be able to performe her buſineſſe.</p>

               <p>About our Ladie daie in Lent is the time when theſe kindes of hawkes doe leaue theſe countries, and al other eſtranged places: and they doe begin to drawe togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to diſpoſe themſelues thereunto a moneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8778:30"/>
ſubiect and apt to be loſt, on little or no cauſe at all. And as they differ in the eie of man, and their ages diſagree: ſo is the one more ſubiect to be loſt then the other, by reaſon of their difference. The deed of generation is the verie cauſe they leaue theſe countries for: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are prouoked to repaire into thoſe places of the world, that bee moſt fit and conuenient for them to breed in.</p>
               <p>The old <hi>Haggard</hi> being taken there, or elſewhere, hauing formerlie bred and brought vp manie yong, muſt needs at that time beſet downe, and fed vp with hot and bloodie meat,<note place="margin">Somwhat before our Ladie day.</note> becauſe nature (hauing long had his courſe) prouokes her with greater violence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare herſelfe vnto her kinde, with purpoſe to be gone: which courſe of nature, if you ſhould reſtraine, and ſeeke by force to make her ſerue your turne, ſhe would with a longing languiſhing deſire, conſume her ſelfe to naught.</p>
               <p>The <hi>intermewed Haggard</hi> is more able and ſtrong to reſiſt the courſe of nature: becauſe it is not ſo violent in her as in the former: yet is ſhee ſubiect to the ſame at that time of the yeare.

                  <hi>CHAP.</hi> II. Heere followeth certaine neceſſary inſtructions to bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of euery Faulconer before he doth put his hawke into the Mew, which is a preparing or making readie of your Hawke for the ſame.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus flying time being paſt, it will now bee conuenient to prepare your hawke for the <hi>Mew,</hi> for the performing whereof, this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing rules will not be found vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>You muſt beware and take heede, at the firſt, (when you doe purpoſe and alſo begin to feede vp your hawke and couet to fill her full of fleſh, that ſhe be not her own caruer in her diet, nor that you doe giue vnto her no great gorge your ſelfe: for if you doe, it is ten to one ſhe will ouerfeede and ſurfeit on the ſame, as you ſhall plainely perceiue if you will marke with obſeruation that which followeth.</p>
               <p>Whereas you haue perceiued that your hawke all her flying time hath continued with you ſound and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: and by the mending of your hand a little towards her with good meane ſomthing more then ordinarie, ſhe would alwaies thriue of her fleſh, and increaſe in health to your liking: yet now at the ſetting downe, and time of reſt, you doe (out of your loue, and to the intent to fill her full of fleſh) giue her good meate, and full gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges euerie daie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the ſpace of a ſeauenight, or a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8778:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
togeather, it may be longer, and yet in all that time finde ſmall amendement or none at all: this no doubt will make you wonder that your coſt and care takes no greater effect, but that you finde your <hi>Hawke</hi> rather worſe then better by it: for vnleſſe you know the reaſon of it, it cannot chooſe but ſeeme ſtrange vnto you. I haue had this queſtion propounded vnto me diuerſe times concerning <hi>Hawkes</hi> in this eſtate, which although I am well aſſured euerie good <hi>Faulconer</hi> of time and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periecne, can iudge ſufficientlie, not onely of the cauſe, but alſo of the remedie, and how to preuent it: yet in regard there are manie keepers of <hi>Hawkes</hi> doe lack that knowledge, and for want thereof haue ſpoiled and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited manie good <hi>hawkes:</hi> I will for their inſtructions ſpeake more at large concerning this matter.</p>
               <p>Whereas before during the time of her flying, your <hi>Hawke</hi> did by chance, now and then meete with ſome good meate more then ordinarie, as ſomtime the fleſh of Fowle, or the like taken by her ſelfe; or otherwiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on her by you, in regard of her good deſerts; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the which it may bee you haue ſeene her feede haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, or with greedineſſe, and yet you haue not perceiued that ſhe hath been the worſe, but the better for the ſame. From whence you muſt vnderſtand that ſhe commonlie did win that with labour of her body, and the vſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of her wings, which was a great helpe and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to her diſgeſture: beſides the <hi>Faulconer</hi> (being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in his art) will out of his diſcretion, either in the morning, or at euening, after ſuch extraordinarie feede, conſider what danger it might procure, and ſo giue her ſtones to preuent the gathering or ingendering of anie ſuperfluous glut or humor, which might thereby offend her, and ſo with diligent care continue a moderate and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8778:32"/>
meane diet after.</p>
               <p>But now you ceaſe and leaue off from all thoſe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices and obſeruations of the flying time, and your onlie pretence and purpoſe is to giue reſt and good feed vnto your <hi>Hawke,</hi> to the end to raiſe and fill her full of fleſh, whereby ſhe may be made ready for the <hi>Mew.</hi> And to the'nent ſhe ſhould proſper and be brought to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, you doe at her firſt ſetting downe, giue her as much as ſhe liſt to take into her gorge, thinking thereby to effect your purpoſe the ſooner: but therein you ſhall ſoone finde that you haue deceiued your ſelfe, for your <hi>Hawke</hi> being newlie taken from flying, at which time you kept her with a good ſtomack and ſparing diet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ſuffered to take what ſhe will, doth out of the heat and greedineſſe of her ſtomacke, fill her ſelfe full vpon the ſodaine, that for want of digeſture, (which ſhe muſt needes lack by reaſon of her continuall reſt, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no exerciſe, nor other meanes to procure the ſame) her ſodaine fulnes doth ſo ſuffocate and ſtop the pooers which are then open, and other paſſages of nutriment, that ſhe will be preſently ſtunted by thoſe obſtructions, and not onely be forced to ſtand long at a ſtaie, before ſhe can be recouered, but many times ſhe will languiſh &amp; fal into manie ſurfets and diſeaſes, by reaſon of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Therefore to auoid theſe inconueniences, you muſt keepe your <hi>Hawke</hi> all the flying time as cleane as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you may, then at her ſetting downe keepe your won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted courſe in feeding twice a daie, and as neer as you can with hot and bloodie meate, and no more in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then you ſhall finde her well able to endure &amp; put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie: and be ſure to take heede of ſuffering her to glut her ſelfe too full at the firſt: and by vſing this order you ſhall finde that if ſhe be ſound, ſhe will thriue of her fleſh
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8778:32"/>
in a ſhort ſpace, which if you perceiue, that within the week or the fortnight ſhe is amended, to your liking, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may you be bold to begin to feed her once a day, and if it be poſſible let her haue yong pigeons at the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a more moiſt and delicat feed, and eaſlier to be endued then any old feed: but if there be none of thoſe to be had, then you muſt be content to take what you can get, neuertheleſſe be ſure that her firſt gorges of the laſt kind be reaſonable and eaſie in quantity for a while, becauſe at that time of the yeere, old feed is more drie and hard of diſgeſture then at other times, or then yong pigeons be.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing vſed this courſe, and by your owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion finding the time fit, to leaue feeding twice a day, alſo obſeruing how ſhee likes and mends by her feeding once a day, how the eagernes of her ſtomacke doth abate, and according to theſe obſeruations to rule and order her with art and diſcretion, you ſhall be ſure to haue your hawke raiſed in her fleſh, encreaſed and ſetled in her health, being thereby made readie and fit for the Mew, into which ſhee may be put ſhortlie after, and no doubt there continue ſafe and ſound, while ſhee remaines there. Contrariwiſe if you doe put your hawke into the Mew; without anie ſuch preparation, or while ſhee is abroad to ſuffer her to eat as much as ſhee will, or to giue her at one time a whole old doue, drie and tough, you ſhall find it wil ſuddenly put the ſoundeſt hawke that is vnto a ſtand, and by this onlie meanes, ſurfetted and ſpoiled manie a hawke: and there are verie few that ſcape which are ſo v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and then it is imagined they haue taken ſome blowes or bruſes in their flights, or haue beene wronged ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, when (indeed) theres no ſuch matter, but euen are deſtroied by haſtie extraordinarie feeding, and by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous

Then when you thinke it conuenient take her gentlie and fairelie vnto your fiſt, and carrie her vp and downe, ſtroaking her with a feather lightlie and gently, and if you doe perceiue her beginne to ſtirre, and grow vnquiet, ſet her downe againe, and thus vſe her, vntill by degrees you haue drawne her to ſome reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble familiaritie; which when you haue gained, and that ſhee will begin to feed, then giue her more carriage, and vſe her vnto it more and more, and be ſure ſtill to keepe her as quiet as may be, and ſeeke by all meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent her bateing; for there is more danger in ſome one Hawke, that is to be reclaimed and inſeamed from the Mew, then is in manie other Hawkes that haue beene newlie taken in <hi>England</hi> or from the cage, or anie other place whatſoeuer, for they that are newlie taken here in

                  <hi>England,</hi> doe come from the labor of their bodies and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their wings, pare not fat (if I may terme it ſo) therefore they in their reclaiming and making cannot ſo ſuddenlie heat themſelues by bating or otherwiſe, but they may be better preſerued from anie hurt, and if it doe chance that they miſcarrie thereby, yet may they then be more eaſilie cured. Likewiſe thoſe that come from the cage, and were taken beyond the ſeas and haue been toſſed and tumbled vp and downe, I doe heare few that buy them, complaine of their fatnes or ouermuch fulneſſe, and therefore they are alſo ſo much the more from that danger, but that hawke which is mewed and kept therein by the man, ſhee is whollie reſtrained of her libertie, and kept vp in a narrow roome, where ſhee feeds with eaſe, and gets her fulneſſe with ſitting ſtill,<note place="margin">If your hawk come full from the mew giue her no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting till the third weeke, many will thinke to haue their hawkes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to flie in that time, but manie times their haſty affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and make void their unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> ſo that there is no one crammed fowle or bird, that will be more fat and full then ſhee, and therefore no one of the other ſort of hawks is in a quarter of that danger in their inſeaming that ſhee is in, vnleſſe ſhee be moſt carefullie kept, &amp; curiouſlie vſed vntill ſhee be through inſeamed. Thus not fearing but this ſhort admonition will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to euery carefull Fawlconer, concerning this one materiall and neceſſarie obſeruation, I will proceed.</p>
               <p>When you haue brought her to eat, you muſt feed her twice a day, and ſo order and diet her continuallie, and it muſt be with new and good meat, which you muſt dreſſe and waſh cleane, wringing out the blood with faire wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that ſhee may the ſooner come vnto a ſtomacke, and for the quantity thereof let it be as much as the wing of an old doue at once, or as you ſhall find her to put away the one meale, and make her ſelfe fit and ready for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and for the firſt weeke, or ten daies after, ſhee begin to feed, giue her neither caſting not ſtones; but the weeke
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8778:35"/>
after giue her halfe a dozen ſtones euerie night, after ſhee hath put away her ſupper from forth her gorge,<note place="margin">You muſt take this courſe with any manner of long win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Hawke that is drawn from the mew.</note> which you ſhal find ſhe wil caſt &amp; render vnto you againe in the morning verie early. The third weeke approaching, you muſt giue her euery night a caſting, ſtill bearing in minde your former manner of diet or feed, which you muſt continue vntill your hawke be flying, and all her flying time, only adding vnto her meales ſomewhat in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and forbearing to waſh altogether ſo hard, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the hardnes or mildnes of the weather, and as your owne diſcretion ſhall lead and direct you in finding her to flie and grow ſubiect to your demaund my reaſons for diſpoſing of her vſage in theſe ſeuerall ſorts are theſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt weeke or ſomewhat more, ſhee wil be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnfit and vnready for ſtones, or caſting, by reaſon of her ramagenes, beſide ſhee will be poſſeſſed with fretting angrie humors, which will not ſo ſoone be wrought out of her: likewiſe if either of them ſhould be giuen her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her full pride of greaſe, ſhee may keepe them, and neuer caſt them, as I haue (for a certaine truth) both ſeen and proued: otherwiſe ſhee may fall ſicke with ſtirring or remoouing her greaſe too ſoone.</p>
               <p>The ſecond weeke by meanes of the Fawlconers skill and paines taken, the weeke before her anger and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting will be ſomewhat aſſwaged, ſhee will be gentle to ſit vnhooded, and will haue well emptied her bowels, and ſcowred forth ſome of her looſe droſſe and reliques of imperfection, and then ſhee will be fit to receiue ſtones, and apt to caſt them againe.</p>
               <p>This being effected the ſecond weeke, then againſt the third weeke ſhee will be prepared with a reaſonable ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, to take her caſting willingly, and not be curious to doe the like afterwards, which ſhee muſt haue euery

night,<note n="*" place="margin">Vntill your exerciſe be with labor you can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make her cleane, nor keepe her cleane.</note> it may be as yet you ſhall not find by her caſting, nor her mutes, much greaſe to come from her, nor that ſhee inſeameth, nor yet reclaimeth according to your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, yet let not that trouble you, but now prepare your ſelfe to lure her, and let her exerciſe and haue the benefit of her wings: Then trie with ſtones now and then to ſtir her againe, and as neere as you can by night; for I haue learned by experience that ſtones giuen once by night doe more good vnto a hawke, then twice by day, for ſpeedie inſeaming or remouing anie glut or euill humor, which the hawks bodie is ſubiect vnto: for in the morning, although ſhee haue need enough to keepe them, yet a greedie appetite (which naturallie ſhee hath at that time of the day) often times prouoks her to caſt them before they haue halfe exerciſed there vertue and operation in her, ſo that ſhee receiueth little libertie or none at all by them: and contrariwiſe according to her neceſſity ſhee will ſometimes keepe them all day and all night if you would ſuffer her, for you ſhall perceiue that ſhee will euen reſolue as it were with her ſelfe ſo to doe by growing vnquiet, and by begging and crauing meat of her Keeper for her dinner, the ſtones being ſtill in her; and in my conceit, who ſo ſuffers her not then to haue her will and deſire; but ſtriueth to contradict her, doth her much wrong, for if at the preſent ſhee haue hers, the next morning he ſhall haue his, I meane his ſtones with her health increaſed.</p>
               <p>I haue obſerued that moſt men can be well content to giue vnto their Hawke a peece of Flannell or Cotten, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though foule and ſlurred, which being receiued into her body, ſhee finds it ſo farre differing from her naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, as ſometimes ſhee will caſt it vp in the morning all blacke and tawnie, and ſometimes with it meat vndige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8778:36"/>
which ſheweth how lothſome it is vnto her, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when it is giuen without perfect ſcowring and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet we neuer ſo much as dreame that this euer offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth any Hawke; but ſurely it doth either a ſound hawke cleane, or an vnſound Hawke whether ſhee be foule or cleane. Therefore ſeeing it hath beene, is, and euer wil be giuen vnto Hawkes for caſting. It is meet that you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and take notice how and when it is fitteſt and beſt to be giuen. Firſt of all you muſt be ſure that it be perfectly and well waſhed, and ſo kept, for there is no ſuch thing, nor any other thing, that paſſeth into the body of the hawke; but the ſtomacke worketh and ſtriueth by nature to digeſt it, as doe euidently appeare by the hard bones ſhee eateth, from whence it ſucketh all the marrow, and other moiſture, ſo doth it in like manner from the wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len whatſoeuer is poſſible to be withdrawne, which is vnnaturall, and therefore muſt needs be vnwholeſome: wherefore to giue it when your Hawke is inſeaming, and foule in her greaſe, and that alſo broken in her, it is more tollerable; for then her ſtomacke is not ſo apt or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſauor or taſt it, (being then coied and peſtered with groſſe humors) as it will be after, when it is freed and cleanſed from them: Alſo then it often times (through the annoyance of the hot &amp; greaſie ſauor) doth prouoke your hawke to caſt in the morning before her houre, or that ſhee hath perfectly endured her ſupper which will appeare and plainely ſhew in the tawnie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of her caſting vnwrapped, and the like colour and muddineſſe of the water within it, therefore if there be no remedy but we muſt vſe it, let it be as it is before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and when you giue the eaſieſt and lighteſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and ſome plummage with it: but otherwiſe neuer vpon a great gorge: no not vnto the ſoundeſt hawke that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8778:36"/>
is: alſo in a morning when your hawke makes a looſe, and vnwrapped caſting of plummage, it is good to giue a little knot with ſtones, to bring away looſe or ſtragling feathers out of the pannell; or els at ſome other time with ſtones in the morning, and view the colour of it, whereby you may iudge the ſtate of your hawkes bodie, for by it you ſhall gather and perceiue whether ſhee be hot and drie, or moiſt, and in good temper; or greaſie, or cleane. If ſhee be hot and drie, the caſting will be euen as it were ſcorched blacke, yet neuertheleſſe it may be wrapped, and the water in it reaſonable cleere, which if you find, let her haue no more caſting of that kind; but in ſtead thereof giue her plummage, and ſhee will doe well ſo long as the water is ſo good: for it is nothing but her diſlike of the vnkindneſſe of the cotton: But there is more danger to be doubted, when as the caſting appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth as I ſaid before blackiſh and tawny, and no water, but a roaping froth in it, which ſheweth and ſignifieth more heat and drought then in the other, yet if it be wrapped you need feare the leſſe: and commonly this is found in ſuch Hawkes, as are not made thorough clean at the firſt before they be flowne, but are hot often in that eſtate: neuertheleſſe if ſhee be well ordered and carefully attended after, thoſe imperfections will eaſily be wrought out of her, which to effect take this courſe. Giue her one weeks reſt, and feed her with good meat, and eaſie gorges of the ſame: alſo giue her ſome very faire and cleane water with it, and ceaſe for that week to giue her any caſting at all, but euery night after ſhee hath put away her ſupper, giue her halfe a dozen ſmall ſtones with the ſtumpe of a wing: then at the weeks end becauſe you cannot proue her eſtate ſo well, by the colour of the caſting of plummage, giue her a little ſupper, and after
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8778:37"/>

Hawkes</hi> by kinde,<note place="margin">It is not good to giue your Hawk ſtones at that time when yow know ſhe wil be vnquiet.</note> will not in that ſhort time (ſpoken of before) be ſo well reclaimed, but that they will haue pride, and a ſtirring humor in them ſtill, and eſpecially in the morning after their night reſt. Therefore for this one cauſe of their vnquietneſſe, to which they are much addicted in the morning, and alſo for the time of their inſeaming &amp; reclaiming, the night is beſt: for then your <hi>Hawke</hi> is addicted quietlie to take her reſt, without ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſtirring, or ſtraining of her bodie, being charged with ſtones. But ſome will ſay the night is too long, and that they doe ouer heat her: but by due obſeruation I haue found; it is not ſoe, whenſoeuer ſhe hath neede and deſireth or deſerueth to haue them: for certaine it is I haue ſeene a <hi>Hawke</hi> in the time of her flying, that hath taken a dozen or more of ſtones her ſelfe in a morning, and hath kept halfe of them till the next morning. Alſo I haue knowne the ſame <hi>Hawke</hi> when they haue been giuen vnto her by the man at the ſame time, would not miſſe at her feeding time, or at the ſight of meate to caſt halfe of them, and keepe the reſt till the next daie, which <hi>Hawke</hi> I haue recouered and brought to perfection, &amp; orderlie caſting, onely with a moderate diet, and ſtones giuen her in the night without anie trouble or diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto the <hi>Hawk</hi> at al, which otherwiſe ſhe might haue receiued through bating, ſtriuing, and ſuch vnquietnes in the morning after her reſt, all which moſt <hi>Hawkes</hi> of mettell and courage are ſubiect vnto at that time, which is often a great cauſe that <hi>Hawkes</hi> doe keepe their ſtones in the morning. All which doe manifeſtly proue that the night is beſt.</p>
               <p>Alſo I haue ſeene <hi>Hawkes</hi> many a time (for want of orderlie gouernment) haue kept their ſtones the moſt part of a day, and ſome of them till the next daie, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8778:38"/>
not miſſe to doe the like whenſoeuer they were giuen them in the morning. I had alſo one <hi>Hawke</hi> my ſelfe where now I dwel, which my maſter bought, and I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her with ſtones in her, which was made knowne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and that it was her accuſtomed order to keepe them, or her caſting, or both togeather, and that ſhe did vſe to flie with ſom ſtones &amp; her caſting in her. This p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh cuſtom I altered and quickly changed, and brought her to caſt them all, and orderly, onely by keeping a ſteddie and carefull hand in the quality and quantity of her diet and feeding, not giuing her ſomtimes too little, and ſom times too much, but keeping and obſeruing a meane, and eſpecially vpon ſuch occaſions. It is the carefull feeding of your <hi>Hawke</hi> that makes her ſeruicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for there is no <hi>Hawke</hi> but will flie according as ſhe is ordered and gouerned, as if her ſtomacke be right, ſhe will flie with ſpirit, courage, and attention to the man, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe if it be cold and dull, ſhe will flie wilde and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſly, and on plaines and howſes, all which is diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in a <hi>Hawke,</hi> and ſhews the <hi>Faulconer</hi> faileth of his art, and ſuch occaſions giue cauſe to any <hi>Hawke</hi> to caſt at aduenture, and not at any certaine time. Alſo in curing of the foreſaid <hi>Hawke,</hi> as I vſed a certainety in her diet: ſo alſo I haue euermore a care to feede very cleane, which is an other eſpeciall note to bee marked by all <hi>Faulconers,</hi> for in ſo doeing, they ſhall be ſure to keepe their <hi>Hawkes</hi> in temper and cleane: for thereby they cannot retain any ſuperfluity of glut, or any other thing, which otherwiſe might hurt the ſtomacke, and breede ſickneſſe, in the bodie, and is a ſpeciall cauſe to make them caſt either ſtones or caſting diſorderlie, and out of courſe.</p>
               <p>Another order which I tooke for this purpoſe, was
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8778:38"/>
that I continually vſed her vnto ſtones at night, &amp; neuer failed to giue her few or manie euery night (with moſt conueniency for the number) vntill I had changed and altered her diſordered kinde of caſting, and fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht my deſire, which I the ſooner brought to pas, by reaſon of this laſt practiſe of giuing her ſtones by night: and to proue that it is the beſt time to giue any <hi>Hawke</hi> ſtones in, but eſpecially ſuch as ſhall bee perceiued to haue the like neede,<note n="*" place="margin">Her deſire to the ſtones is known by her long kee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ping and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and * deſireth them in that manner before reherſed, I will ſet downe one example more of mine owne experience.</p>
               <p>I haue an other <hi>Hawke,</hi> which was a <hi>Haggard-ſlight-Faulcon,</hi> that when I came into the <hi>Mew</hi> with her din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, did caſt vp ſom few ſtones at the ſight of the meate, and when ſhe had eaten vp the ſame, (being a yong <hi>Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) ſhe preſently tooke aboue a dozen more, which ſhe kept vntill the next day.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe where now I liue, and in my time, there was a <hi>Taſſell-gentle,</hi> that after hee had eaten a whole yong <hi>Pigeon,</hi> tooke preſently 15, or 16. ſtones vnto the ſame, for proofe whereof I haue many of the beſt in <hi>Bletſhoe</hi> howſe to teſtifie the ſame) he alſo made it ſomthing late the next day before he did caſt them, which apparently ſhewed that he naturally loued them, and that they did him good, and quickned his diſgeſture. Theſe ſtones were euery morning after laid by him, being faire and cleane waſht, which he neuer miſſed to take in a moneth togeather, yet at the ſight of his meate, he would not faile to caſt ſom or all of them, which is a common thing that may be marked in <hi>Hawkes,</hi> not only in the <hi>Mew,</hi> but alſo in their flying time, the which proueth that <hi>Hawkes</hi> may be by many occaſions prouoked to caſt thoſe ſtones which are giuen them in the morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8778:39"/>
they haue wrought to any purpoſe in them, and it was nothing elſe but that diſtempered and vntimely ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, which made that <hi>Hawke</hi> continue ſo long before he could cure him ſelfe, whereas otherwiſe if he had been vndertaken by his keeper, and vſed vnto them at nights, though not ſo many at once, yet would he ſooner haue bin cured. Alſo this aduiſeth, that men ſhould be ſo skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and withall ſo carefull as to eſpie when their <hi>Hawks</hi> haue neede of ſtones, and then not to let ſlip opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from one time vnto an other, &amp; to giue them now and then by chance as on the holy daie, or at times of beſt leiſure, but they muſt applie them by daie or night con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually with diſcretion, vntill they be cured, and ſhall caſt in due time. And whenſoeuer you doe finde your <hi>Hawke</hi> to fit long in the morning before ſhe doth caſt, and in the end alſo doth keepe ſome of them ſtill, then be ſure to ceaſe to leaue of quite in the morning, and vſe her onely vnto them at night, and aſſure your ſelfe if ſhe haue no other deadly infirmity in her, they will worke a true effect, and cauſe her to caſt orderlie at all times, If ſhe doth caſt as ſhe ſhould doe, it muſt be within an howre and a halfe: if they be giuen in the morning: for if ſhe doth not, either her health, or her gouernment are imperfect.</p>
               <p>Alſo when your <hi>Hawke</hi> is in her beſt caſe, and prime of her flying, and as cleane as may be, yet then forget not (when you may conueniently) as ſpecially after franke or good feede, or in time of reſt, to giue ſtones with iudgement in her wants: for as they doe worke to cleanſe &amp; purge any thing that is bred in her ſtomacke: ſo likewiſe are they of operation to preuent any euill that is there to be ingendred or bred, if it be of ſubſtance to be wrought vpon: for indeede there is no ſuch phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8778:39"/>
for a <hi>Hawke,</hi> as to giue her ſtones in due and neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full time; and little doe yong <hi>Faulconers</hi> imagine how kindely their natures doe agree the one with the other. I heard one ſay that after a tedious flight flowne with his <hi>Hawke,</hi> hee would giue her ſtones to coole her withall, which act of his though I did well allow of, yet did I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow of his opinion concerning their effects, for indeed he knew what he did in action, but not in operation: for no doubt he thought thoſe ſtones with their cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would not only coole her for the preſent,<note place="margin">He knew he gaue her ſtones, but he knew not their effects.</note> but alſo that they onely wrought a cold effect, and ſo continued all the time ſhe poſſeſt them, which opinion of his was altogeather vntrue, for if it were poſſible to haue ſuch ſtones, they would doe no good at all: and becauſe I know that many doe deceiue themſelues and others in this reſpect, I will heere ſhew you my opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame. Firſt, although it is moſt certaine that after ſhe doth caſt her ſtones, and thoſe ill humors as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore poſſeſt her ſhee is cooled, and the extreame heate (bred by reaſon of thoſe ſuperfluous humors) much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid, yet during the time that ſhe enioyeth them, ſhe is made more hot by them, and they by her: and for more confirmation of the ſame, let me aske you one queſtion, wherefore doe you giue ſtones to that <hi>Hawke</hi> which you haue newly taken and drawne out of the <hi>Mew,</hi> and doe intend with reaſonable expedition to make ready to be ſlowne? It is not in plaine termes to melt and waſte that glut and fatneſſe that ſhe hath gathered, and is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and growne in her pannell, with her full and franke feeding in the time of her reſt and <hi>mewing</hi> and to make the ſame ready, and fit to paſſe away &amp; ſcowre through her downeward in her <hi>mutes,</hi> as alſo to aſcend and bee drawne and purged vpwards by the ſame ſtones, and her
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8778:40"/>
caſting, that ſo ſhe might be euacuated and emptied of thoſe gurgitiue and ſtuffing humors, and be inſeamed and made cleane and ready to be put to labour ſo much the ſooner. If this be true? wherefore then ſhould any man thinke that it is poſſible for ſtones with their cooleneſſe to worke a cooling effect at their inſtant being in the <hi>Hawke?</hi> or why ſhould any man giue them for that purpoſe, ſeeking thereby to procure that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is no neede? for there is no ſounde <hi>Hawke</hi> gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken from the <hi>Mew,</hi> that is ouer hot, and moderately hot and cold, and in a meane temper, in reſpect of her naturall heat and coldneſſe, vnles afterwards ſhe be with ill vſage ouer heat and wronged. And alſo on that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, if the vertue of ſtones were preſent coldneſſe it would hazard preſent death to giue them: for preſent heat and ſodaine cold cannot agree togeather; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although I doe not allow to giue them to ſome, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter drawing out of the <hi>Mew</hi> in the prime and extreameſt fulnes of fleſh, (for the reaſons which I haue formerly alledged) yet in conuenient time after the ſame, as I haue aduiſed, and alwaies after long and tedious flights and toiling: for thereby you ſhall keep them in a temperate heate and preuent ſuddaine cooling, it will conſume their greaſe, and remoue ſlime and glut, and by them the whole body will be brought into good temper, being poſſeſt with no other but naturall heate, with the like kindly coolnes: for as you may perceiue, your <hi>Hawke</hi> by nature and kinde is hot, as plainely appeareth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery <hi>Faulconer.</hi> And by her long and tedious flights &amp; labour, ſhe is made more hot, all which heat if it ſhould coole ſodainely would no doubt bring her into no ſmal danger, but much more if the ſtones ſhould likewiſe bee of a cold operation, ſhe muſt needes by all theſe ſodain
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8778:40"/>
contrarieties be brought to her death: but contrariwiſe ſtones do preuent the ſame: for they being by her heat made hot themſelues, doe ſo continue in her,<note place="margin">After a toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling flight at euening, if you miſtruſt either greſe or vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, let your Hawke haue time to plum &amp; giue good blood for contentment but little meat or none ſet her vp warme, and giue ſtones ſo ſoone as may be.</note> and by vertue of their heat doe not only keepe her temperate but alſo doe diſſolue any ſuperfluous humor incident to <hi>Hawkes</hi> already ingendered, &amp; doe preuent the bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of any other that may grow by reaſon of her long labour the ſodaine cooling of her greace, or any other accident or chance whatſoeuer. All which being meanes to breede many imperfections in the ſtomacke (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ariſeth heat, ſlime, and whitiſh froth appearing in the mouth of the <hi>Hawke</hi>) are by vertue of their heate cleane euacuated &amp; forced from their receptacles, and places of abode, wherby the <hi>Hawk</hi> is afterwards cooled &amp; brought into a temperate diſpoſition of body. So that you ſee although the ſtones do yeeld a heating operation, while they remain in the <hi>Hawke,</hi> yet afterwards there is a coole effect wrought and produced by them.</p>
               <p>Furthermore doe you of long practiſe and experience but remember; that whereas ſometimes you haue percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued your Hawke by al ſignes and ſhowes to be free from any extraordinary heat at all: neuertheleſſe vpon your forbearance a while, before and after to giue ſtones: Then when you did giue them the next time, let me but aske you whether you haue ſeen your hawke oftentimes at her beginning to caſt before the ſtones, in the mid'ſt, and at the end of them, euen to ſtreane and guſh out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of wateriſh and yellow greaſie ſlime and glut from forth her body, or no? which as it is moſt true that euery obſeruing Faulconer haue, or might haue ſeene ſo much; then muſt it neceſſarily follow that ſtones and the property of them being in the hawkes body, is firſt to heat and purge before they coole. I make no doubt when
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8778:41"/>
you gaue no ſtones, you failed not to giue caſting euery night, but yet you perceiued not her glut to flow from her at any time, with her caſting as with her ſtones, which ſheweth that ſtones are phiſical and cauſe her to purge vpwards and through her: Furthermore obſerue this one thing, when you haue your hawke perfect cleane, doe but forbeare one weeke to giue her ſtones, and all that time you ſhall ſee her make perfect and cleane ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, and though you proue her with caſting of cotton, yet it will be cleane and white, then at the weeks end for triall of the property of ſtones, giue her halfe a dozen at night with a knot of flannel, or halfe a ſcore in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the ſame; and you ſhall ſee the flannell will be yellow and greaſy, which ſheweth that the ſtones haue euen melted and diſſolued that greaſe, which in that ſhort time was bred and began to grow in her: all which doe apparantly proue that they doe neuer coole at the inſtant, but heat and purge that coldneſſe may grow thereon.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe if ſloth and idleneſſe with other mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, did not (often times in ſome of the beſt of vs) croſſe and preuent both our skill and diligence, but that wee might with cleane feed and ſtones keep our hawkes free from all vncleannes, they would neuer be ouerhot, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it poſſible to ouerheat ſuch a hawke with flying that is perfect cleane, and in breath; for if you ſhould flie her out of reaſon, which is not meet, yet when ſhee is weary ſhee will goe to a ſtand and reſt her, as the wilde Hawke is oftentimes compelled to doe, yet neuer trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with heat ſo long as ſhee keepeth her ſelfe cleane. Therefore let me aduiſe you to be carefull euermore to keepe your hawkes cleane, for it is your ſuffering them to continue in their vncleannes, and for want of giuing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8778:41"/>
them ſtones often enough to purge them withall, that cauſeth and prouoketh heat to grow and ariſe fuming in them: And this may ſuffice to confute the opinion of thoſe that being asked wherefore they doe giue their hawke ſtones, and doe thinke the night is too long, doe anſwere that it is to coole them, and verily beleeue that they haue no other operation or working in them but to coole: but here by reaſon you may ſee how much they are deceiued, and how void of true vnderſtanding this their opinion is: and of this be ſure,<note place="margin">Remember that a fat Hawke maks a leane horſe, a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Faulconer &amp; an empty purſe: three diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties befitting euery man to beware of. The wild Hawke will ſometimes attend.</note> you ſhall find it an eaſier matter when your Hawke is cleane, ſo to keep her, then when ſhee is fowle to make her cleane. Therefore it is meet for euery man at the beginning to make his hawk perfectly cleane, and ſo to keep her without pampering, with great meales to make her ſit, and ſeeme faire vpon the fiſt, for thereby doth ſundry euils grow, beſides diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience towards her Keeper, which is the greateſt euill of all: yet ſome men will ſeldome take any care at all, either to keepe their Hawkes cleane, or to haue them empty when they doe flie them; but doe preſume that their loue to the man, fowle, and their owne mettell, will cauſe them to flye and kill without any ſtomacke at all, which I will not denie but by chance may ſo fall out, but aſſure your ſelfe it will not continue long: for there is no Hawke being put to labour, and forced to ſtretch and ſtraine her wings, when her bowels be filled and charged with meat, but is in great danger of her life; and beſides ſhee will neuer flie with regard and attention to her Keeper, becauſe her ſtomacke is not perfect; which (as I haue formerly ſhewed you) is the principall gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her in all her actions, for proofe whereof marke this in ſuing obſeruation.</p>
               <p>Take any younger Hawke out of the neſt (though
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8778:42"/>
newly diſcloſed) and breed her vp as familiarlie as you can deuiſe: yet when you ſhall come afterwards to flye her, ſhee muſt be altogether guided and gouerned by her ſtomacke: yea ſhee will be kept and alſo loſt by the ſame: for let her faile of that neuer ſo little, and euery puft of winde will blow her away from you; nay if there be no wind ſtirring, yet ſhee will wheele and ſinke away from him and from his voice, that all the time before had lured and trained her vp. Contrariwiſe if it be his hap to find her againe, when ſhee is hungry, although ſhee would ſtarue before ſhee would pray for her ſelfe, yet will ſhee then owne him or any other man; nay, ſhee will be ready to take his cap from him, before ſhee will leaue or looſe him.</p>
               <p>This ſhewes how much they doe deceiue themſelues, that becauſe their Hawke doth at ſome time by chance flie well and Kill, being full or vncleane, doe neuer after make any care to haue them empty or cleane when they are flowne: they doe not remember that the wild Hawke (as I haue formerly ſhewed) will ſometimes attend, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with coy and ſtraung behauiour: which ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes you will ſoone finde your manned and reclaimed Hawke to be poſſeſt withall. If you doe often vſe to flie her without a perfect ſtomacke, of which I would wiſh you to be very carefull: for if there ſhould not be a great difference to be diſcerned betwixt your Hawke and the wild Hawke, as well in their flying, as all other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſeruice and ſubiection: it would be an euident ſigne either of much negligence, or ſmall skilfulnes in her Keeper: neither is there any pleaſure or content to be receiued from that Hawke; which for want of good gouernment flieth wide or vncertaine, going as it were at paſſage, and ſtooping here and there without care or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8778:42"/>
reſpect to her Keeper, as if ſhee were wild.</p>
               <p>There is not any Faulconer can appoint, or iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine how long, or how ſhort his flight ſhall be; but it may fall out longer or ſhorter then he expecteth, and it often happeneth to be longer then he lookes for, and euery ſuch long and tedious flight, is vnto a full or an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane Hawke a bitter pill, which cannot well digeſt, whereas your cleane and perfect ſtomacck't Hawe, may fly her ſelfe weary, but neuer take harme. This obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many men lightly paſſe ouer without ſo much as one thought of theſe errors, of fulnes and vncleannes, which notwithſtanding haue beene the bane of diuers good Hawkes.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8778:43"/>
you ſhall doe her as much wrong, for although the <hi>pannell</hi> wil be ſat in the higheſt degree, hauing as it were a leafe of the like fatty ſubſtance within it, yet hath the <hi>Faulconer</hi> a meanes and direct courſe with cleane feed, caſting, and ſtones continually to practiſe and worke withall, whereby (in a reaſonable time) he may diſſolue, ſtir, and remoue the greaſe, glut, or anie other imperfect humor the ſtomacke is ſubiect vnto. Yet, although in the viewe of your owne eye, and in your owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by her mutes, caſtings, and other ſignes, you doe perceiue that ſhe is perfectly cleane in her inward parts, if you doe then ſuffer her to take any heate at all, it is as much as her life is worth: therefore take heede of it, &amp; remember that the whole ſolid body is of greater ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance then the <hi>pannell</hi> is, and harboureth a great deale more fatneſſe then it poſſible can doe: neither can it be inſeamed nor that which is troubleſom taken from it ſo ſoone nor by ſuch meanes as the other may, but you muſt tarry for it, and giue it moderate labour in luring and training it eaſily and gently at the firſt to temper it withall, and ſo by degrees you ſhall well inſeame her in all parts, and breath her: and with cleane and good feede keepe her full of fleſh, and free from all diſeaſes, &amp; haue her ready and altogeather fit to doe you ſeruice.</p>
               <p>By this you may plainely perceiue how much ſome men are deceiued in the inſeaming and flying of their <hi>Hawkes,</hi> who thinke that ſo ſoone as they wil feede with a good ſtomacke, and make good caſtings, that then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two or three times luring,<note place="margin">The fruits of haſtines.</note> they may be bold to put them to ſeruice: but it is not ſo. And let them vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that moſt commonly haſt and raſhnes breed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: for there is no man that can make a <hi>Hawke</hi> that is drawne from the <hi>Mew</hi>) ready to be flowne vnder fiue or ſix weekes if ſhe be a full <hi>Hawke:</hi> for if he doe, he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8778:44"/>
deales not artificially with her, but ſhall hazard her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and what folly is it in that man that to couet and get one fortnight at the beginning, will endanger himſelfe to looſe all the latter end, and his <hi>Hawke</hi> for euer; for it is moſt certaine, and doth commonly fall out ſo: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſuch <hi>Hawkes</hi> doe eſcape and liue that yeere, yet are they neuer worth any thing after:<note place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the heart and of the liuer wil bee black, &amp; the body in di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uers places will haue white ſpecks</note> And if they ſo chance to die, you ſhall find that their greace was ouer-het: for it will lie baked blew to their ſides, and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their body: and their heart and liuer will be hory; and the places where they lay, which will ſufficiently te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the nature of the griefe.</p>
               <p>Therefore note thus much, that what ſhew of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſoeuer you doe find in your Hawke, by her caſting, mutes, or otherwiſe, although you haue taken neuer ſuch paines with her, by caſting, cleane feed, and ſtones, to purge and clenſe her inwardly:<note place="margin">You muſt giue no ſuch traines that may cauſe your Hawke to labor too much at the firſt. Neither muſt looſe her before ſhee haue breath and lightnes.</note> yet doe not beleeue that ſhee is perfectly inſeamed, nor will not be, vntil ſhee doe come to the exerciſe of her wings and labour of her body, after which ſhee will breake greace, and by degrees inſeame throughly: and be ſure that her labor at firſt be not immoderat, for if it be it will ingender griefe; but it muſt be in a meane and moderat manner; Alſo you muſt giue her liberty by degrees to ſtirre her wings, and vſe her body, that there may be no heat exceſſiuely taken, vntill ſhee be throughly inſeamed, and then (as I haue ſhewed you) ſhee may be weary with flying, but ſhee will neuer take harme.</p>
               <p>This may ſhew vnto him that is experienc't plainely, and giue inſtruction to the ignorant as truely, that the inward parts and bowels of the <hi>Hawke</hi> may (by the skill of man, and thoſe meanes which art and nature hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided) be wrought and brought to perfection, before the

               <p>Therefore as the wild Hawke by nature doth know her remedy, and how to ſtay and correct the increaſing of that humor, which if it were ſuffered to abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, would hurt and ouercharge her, therefore ſhee defers no time to preſerue and keep her health; but euery day ſaith, or may ſay vnto her ſelfe, Phiſician helpe thy ſelfe, or els thou muſt periſh: and ſo ſhee detracts no time; but this day prouides for the next: And when ſhee feeds with the moſt greedieſt appetite, euen then ſhee remembers to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:8778:45"/>
day, that ſhee muſt purge to morrow. And therefore as ſhee eats no meat, whereof proceeds not ſomething in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient, that in time may hurt and annoy her ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, ſo doth ſhee alſo neuer faile carefully and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly to take plummage with it,<note place="margin">We ought to miſſe no time with our beſt indeuors.</note> for caſting to clenſe her ſelfe of ſome part thereof the next morning: thereby ſtaying the ſuperfluity and aboundance of that naturall moiſtnes, and glut, which would if it were not corrected ſtaied and kept in order, breed, and cauſe to grow in her many infirmities.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe this her example may giue aduice vnto all Faulconers, that when they haue taken theſe poore birds from their liberty, and as it were from themſelues, into their owne cuſtody: that then they be not ſparing of their beſt indeuours towards them, but be alwaies dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and watchfull to order and gouerne them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their naturall kind, and inclination, vſing them louingly and kindly, and giuing them their dues rightly and in due time. For as whatſoeuer it be that is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in good order, and at conuenient ſeaſons, is likely to prooue ſucceſfull in the end: ſo that which is vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken raſhly without order,<note place="margin">Then wee ſhould haue no need to vſe any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines at al</note> and at a time vnfitting, ſeldome or neuer comes to good, nor deſerues any commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather the indiſcretion and folly of ſuch hare-braind and witleſſe attempters will be ſcorned at, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed by euery vnderſtanding and skilfull Faulconer. And to conclude this point, as there is nothing more hurtfull to mans life, then to follow the counſell of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull Phiſician: ſo likewiſe there is nothing doth ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner caſt away and deſtroy your Hawke, then to commit her to the cuſtody of a Keeper that wants art and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</p>
               <p>I haue not hitherto ſet downe any thing which I haue
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8778:45"/>
receiued, either by aduice or inſtruction from any man this thirty yeares, but out of mine owne practiſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, neither out of any booke written or printed, although I neuer met with ſo vaine a one; but I could find in my ſelfe a will and deſire to read it, though all my profit by it after, were to bleſſe me from being of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor that writ it: And ſo likewiſe ſhall I my ſelfe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to haue this my paines and labour peruſed, and by them more auncient and experienc't then my ſelfe, both cenſured and corrected.</p>
               <p>Thus haue I written and diſcourſed of the <hi>Haggard Faulcon gentle.</hi> Firſt of the manner of her life, or courſe of liuing, while ſhee is abroad in the open aire, either here in <hi>England,</hi> or els where, during the time of her wildnes, all which I haue ſpoken by that experience which I haue woon and attained vnto, not onely by ſerious obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but alſo by great and continuall labour and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, which I haue vſed in ſeeking to find and take them: And I haue likewiſe ſhewed you the meanes how to vſe them at the inſtant: when by cunning and ſubteltie you haue beguiled and taken them: and how by skill and art euer after to order and gouerne them, changing (by your wit and watchfull diligence) their naturall timeritie and wildnes into loue and gentlenes. Further you haue been taught how you may by skill teach them to flye, and make them pliant and ſeruiceable for your vſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>And laſtlie thoſe (whoſe ſelfe conceits doe not hinder them from being rul'd by reaſon) may here be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie inſtructed how to keep and maintaine them in health, without any medicine, ſcowring, or other inward appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vnleſſe it be by ſuch meanes and remedies, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and kind hath taught them for the helping and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

of thoſe griefes and infirmities which they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, being certainely perſwaded that theſe my friendlie admonitions, being grounded vpon the abſolute truth, of vnfallible experience, will not rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nor taſt kindlie in the ſtomacke of many yong men; neither will it ſincke into the heads of ſuch, whoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king braines are neuer at quiet, till like vnto the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc't Phiſician, they haue tried concluſions, though it be with the loſſe of their poore patients liues.

               <p>The <hi>Haggard</hi> of that kinde is moſt commendable, meeteſt to be accompted on, fitteſt to be dealt with all, and eaſieſt to bee made for any pleaſure that can bee thought vpon: for the which any of that kinde hath been vſed, and to reclaime and make her fit to bee ſet to the lure.</p>
               <p>You muſt take the ſame courſe that I haue ſet downe for the <hi>Slight-Faulcon,</hi> being ſure to make her very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and familiar with you, in the houſe and abroad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you enter, or ſet her to it, which with pains and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vſage will quickely bee gained; for they are for the moſt part very kinde and louing <hi>Hawkes,</hi> and will ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly bee reclaimed and made to loue the man. After which time that ſhee ſhall come to be lured looſe, and to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:8778:47"/>
other things, then would ſhe firſt of all be taught to come vnto the pelts of hennes, fowle, <hi>Hearnes,</hi> or any ſuch like things ſo it be dead, for thereby ſhe will not be ouer hot, or eager of it, neither muſt you ſuffer het to touch anie part of the fleſh, to draw as yet her loue from your voice and your hand: but to ſpend onely her time on that in <hi>pluming:</hi> all this time you muſt be cloſe by her, about her, and on your knees, vſing your voice vnto her, with her dinner or ſupper cleane dreſt, and waſht, giuing ſtill vnto her ſome part thereof in bits with your hand, that from thence onely ſhe may be ſatisfied, and in that to be her whole delight, accounting the other in her foote but as a ſtand or means to ſtay her by you, while ſhe receiues her full reward and welcome at your hands, and in vſing this courſe often vnto her, ſhee being a <hi>Hawke</hi> of neuer ſuch ſtrength and ableneſſe to carry, it will in the end ſo reclaime and winne her to your ſelfe, that ſhee will quite forget the ſame:<note place="margin">Shee will forget her ovvne ſtrength.</note> and after if you liſt to traine her with <hi>Doues</hi> ſhe will not carry one feather from you, but drawe towards you, and euer deſire to haue her content at your hand: for example, I my ſelfe did know one <hi>Ger-Faulcon</hi> that was as good as euer did flie to the <hi>Hearne;</hi> neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe whenſoeuer ſhee did pull downe any one, her loue was ſo exceeding great to her keeper, that if he did come in to the fall, before the <hi>Hearne</hi> was dead, ſhe would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently forſake the quarry and flie to him for her reward, which he continually with great care and skill had giuen and vſed her vnto at her firſt making: ſo would ſhee doe; alſo although ſhee had killed it, and taken blood theron. This proueth what a ſpeciall point it is in a <hi>Faulconer</hi> to take good time at the firſt making of any <hi>Hawke:</hi> for as ſhe is made then, ſo ſhall he euer finde her after, and if ſhee be well made, ſhe is twice made, nay ſhe is euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly

And let this one note (learn him to amend that error.

               <p>Likewiſe you ought to haue this conſideration with you, and know that there are not any kindes of <hi>Hawkes</hi> ſeeke to winne their prey careleſly, &amp; through diſaduantage as they liſt, but altogeather through great labour and the beſt aduantage, and ſhee that is the beſt wild <hi>Hearnnor</hi> that euer flew, or flew ſleare, and doth by nature prey and loue to feede on them in the time of her wildneſſe, I ſay that by the ſame nature and kinde, euen ſhe is taught to vnderſtand and know the difference, and when ſhe is fit and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

               <p>Secondly, for the other olde or yong <hi>Hawke,</hi> whether ſhe be: but if ſhe be a freſh <hi>Haggard</hi> or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts ſhe will bee ſo much the more able to abide ſome hardſhip, both in her diet and labour: Neuertheles at the firſt you know not whether ſhe hath formerly diſpoſed her ſelfe ſome other way, and ſetled her loue &amp; deſire on ſome other thing quite contrarie to your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and therefore you ought to be carefull at the firſt of theſe former obſeruances, and allſo to know that then nature muſt be changed, and ſhe her ſelfe new made and framed to your will: for which cauſe you ought to be carefull of your courſe, and expert in your Art: for although nature preſenteth the ſubiect, yet oftentimes Art doth, and muſt of neceſſity perfect the ſame.</p>
               <p>And let me further aduiſe all yong men, that eyther are, or would be <hi>Faulconers,</hi> that they doe not dedicate or diſpoſe themſelues awry to other exerciſes, or variety of pleaſures: for if they doe, they ſhall neuer bee expert in this curious art of <hi>Faulconry:</hi> therefore they muſt be no Table or Card players, or other kinde of gameſters, they muſt be no exceſſiue drinkers or Tobacco takers, but when their <hi>Hawkes</hi> be lowſie.</p>
               <p>This time of making and flying being ended, then ought ſhee to be fed vp, and filled full of fleſh by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and after the ſame manner as is before appointed in ſuch a chapter of the ſlight <hi>Faulcon,</hi> and alſo mewed with attentiue and continuall carefull heed; whereas ſhee may euermore ſtand on ſods or turues often ſhifted, that they doe not grow too hard and drie vnder them; but may remaine ſomewhat moiſt and ſoft: for they be verie
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8778:49"/>
heauie <hi>Hawkes,</hi> and ſubiect vnto infirmitie in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of their feet, which is the cauſe it is not thought meet to put them into houſes looſe: which kinde and manner of muing is far better for them then the other: ſo that their pearches of ſtand may be well lined, and made ſoft for them, to fall and reſt vpon: for there ſhee ſhall be at her owne diſpoſing, as if ſhee liſt, to flie from place to place, ſhee may, and it will doe her much good to vſe her ſelfe vnto it: Alſo ſhee may goe to the water if ſhee be diſpoſed, and take ſtones at her pleaſure. Shee may do all things at her owne likes, and ſhee can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at the ſtocke when ſhee would, and is at your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing: neither can you giue her that which is fitting to her owne contenting, but by gueſſe and imagination, wherein manie times we are alltogether deceiued.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the place where I concluded, with the ſtocke there ought alſo great care to be taken, to haue ſpeciall kufter hoods to caſt eaſilie thorough, either plummage, bones, or ſtones, the which ſhee ought to haue verie often giuen vnto her, to purge and cleanſe her, as alſo to preuent the ingendering or growing of too much glut and fatnes in her inward parts, which may be very hurtfull vnto her, and hazzard ſurfettings and her life. All this performed and her ſelfe preſerued vntill ſhe be mewed: then ought you at the leaſt three weekes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you doe take her to your fiſt: to inſeame her with waſht meat and ſtones; for then is the daunger, and the cauſe that doth ſhorten manie of their liues. For there is no man can make one of thoſe <hi>Hawkes</hi> from the <hi>Mew,</hi> ready to be lured vnder ſix weekes at the leaſt, but he ſhal hazzard her life, if ſhee take any heat at all: and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be carefull of that time, and theſe former courſes ſet downe, they are as hard as the Lanner, and will laſt as
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8778:50"/>
long. And I my ſelfe haue knowne one of them an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Hearnor, and to continue her goodnes verie neere twentie yeares, or full out the time: which ſheweth that it is the true care of the <hi>Faulconer,</hi> the right order and method in the managing of his buſines in due time, that bringeth it to right perfection and cauſeth it to continue in the ſame: and for the further ordering of her from the <hi>Mew,</hi> and time of her reſt till ſhee be ready to flie: And for your better inſtruction looke backe vnto the chapter of the ſlight <hi>Faulcon,</hi> whereas I haue written of the ſame matter and eſtate of her in that kind, and there you ſhall find a ſufficient way and direct courſe to ſerue your turne with all. And if you be diſpoſed to frame and make this bird to the riuer, there alſo you ſhall find a chapter to lead you the plaine path way to that delight, and giue you full content: For they are very ſingular and ſpeciall <hi>Hawkes</hi> for that purpoſe.</p>

quiet, and preuent her vnrulineſſe. Alſo it is not good to make too much haſt in the inſeaming of ſuch a <hi>Hawke,</hi> but to take reaſonable leaſure, and not to breake or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe her greaſe too ſoone, fot that takes away her ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, which prolongs and increaſes her vnquietnes, and being ouerheat by the ſame, it cauſeth her to caſt diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and to keepe either ſtones or caſting out of reaſon and due time. It will alſo cauſe her to looſe her fleſh, which will breed weakenes in her body: whereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Crocke and diuers other diſeaſes: and for any of them ſo taken while ſhee is in her greafe, there is no recouery to be expected, vnles by ſome extraordinary worke of art and nature ſhee chaunce to be cured.</p>
               <p>Euery <hi>Faulconer</hi> ſhall find that it is an eaſier matter to preſerue health in a ſound <hi>Hawke,</hi> then to recouer it when it is decaied.

And for ought that I can perceiue, this is the cauſe that makes her liue ſo long, for whereas the reclaimed <hi>Hawke</hi> ſits often at her eaſe, and feeds her ſelfe fat with that ſhe neuer takes pains for, whoſe eaſe and idleneſſe cannot chuſe but breed ill humors, which doe no doubt ſurfet her body, and ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten her life.

to the ſame: ſhee hath ſometimes her fleſh puft vp on the ſuddaine, and as quickly abated, all which being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite and contrary to nature, cannot chooſe but deſtroy nature: for where the qualities are different, there is a continuall ſtrife, and where ſtrife is continued, there muſt needs follow a victory to the one part, which brings a ruin to the other, ſo that theſe differences being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (vnto our reclaimed <hi>Hawkes</hi>) muſt needs cut the thred of their liues before their time. But on the contrary the wilde <hi>Hawke</hi> liues and keepes her ſelfe abroad in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen aire, feeds on good meat,<note n="*" place="margin">He is not ſometimes very fat, and ſometimes very leane, but moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Thus for the moſt part ſhee remaines in a moderate eſtate of body, being ſeldome combred with contraries to impaire her health: and if at any time ſhee find her ſtomacke glutted or ouercharged, ſhee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently repaires to the water, ſtones, or grauel, with which (together with the helpe and benefit of the aire and good diet) ſhee doth purge and recouer her<note n="*" place="margin">Shee doth not as many Faulconers, do when they know their Hawke is diſeaſed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the cu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring thereof from time to time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſhe preſently ſeekes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend what ſhee finds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe.</note> lately loſt health.</p>
               <p>For to ſpeake plainely and in a word, Nature turnes <hi>Faulconer,</hi> and teaches her by theſe materials, and ſelfe ſought helps, not onely how to preuent enſuing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but alſo to cure thoſe incumbrances which prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent miſhap had cauſed her to fall into: and thus ſhee makes her ſelfe ready and fit, for her future labours.

For although in her flying time any

For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he is that hath attained ſo much skill, as in flying time to finde a fault, if he will diligently attend and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue at due times, may in the <hi>Mew</hi> learne to mend a fault: for there he hath a patterne of the wild <hi>Hawkes</hi> practiſe; and as it were a looking glaſſe to behold and ſee how ſhee doth order and gouerne her ſelfe when ſhee is amiſſe: there he may marke how often and many daies together without ceaſing ſhee will take ſtones, and goe to the water, and how ſparing ſhee will be of her diet, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but little, and making choice of her feed, wherein ſhee muſt be aſſiſted by the diligence of her Keeper, who muſt prouide meat of ſeuerall kinds for her, vntill ſhee hath her liking, and not to feed her with one kinde of meat, and becauſe ſhee refuſeth that, ſo to giue her ouer: likewiſe you muſt carefully marke what meat it is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your <hi>Hawke</hi> hath ſurfetted, or hath eaten ſo much of that ſhee is ſicke with it: for ſhee will be ſure to loth that &amp; hate it during the time of her ſickneſſe; and it is not fit that you doe proffer it vnto her any more before ſhee be throughly recouered: for if you doe, and that ſhee chance to diſtaſt it againe, it is ten to one ſhee dies for it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP.</hi> III. How to keepe and preſerue your Hawke in health, without any ſcowrings, or medecines at all.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue in times paſt bin of opinion my ſelfe, that if I might giue my <hi>Hawk</hi> a new deuiſed ſcowring, that it were not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhe ſhould die in a long time after. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I had not ſo much vnderſtanding as to know the true operation of anie one of thoſe ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples it was compounded off, neither whether it went, nor which way it paſſed, but onely in at her mouth, and out with her <hi>mutes.</hi> And no doubt, at this day there be ſome of the ſame minde concerning the one, and of the like wiſedome in reſpect of the other. Therefore I will not ſtand as yet to teach or inſtruct which way to make a ſcowring: for I think they are as common as they are vain, and vſed to little purpoſe &amp; as many &amp; diuers as (almoſt) a <hi>Hawke</hi> hath feathers, which they poore wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches finde to their vtter deſtruction. But heere I thinke it firſt fit to be conſidered what effects theſe ſcowrings doe worke when they are giuen, and in what parts of the <hi>Hawkes</hi> body they be contained, and what can be there harboured for them to purge or work vpon, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by any good or benefit ſhould be procured to the <hi>Hawk</hi> by their meanes.</p>
               <p>Firſt when a ſcowring is giuen to anie <hi>Hawke,</hi> it is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:8778:53"/>
conuaied into the gorge, where it reſts not, but paſſeth downe into the <hi>pannell,</hi> which is the ſtomacke; which place euery <hi>Faulconer</hi> of vnderſtanding knoweth is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied and made cleane euerie morning when ſhe hath caſt, but if by his obſeruation of her caſting he perceiues the contrarie by the foulenes and imperfectnes of the ſame: or that there is anie reliques, as ſtragling looſe feathers, ſuperfluitie of glut, or other impediments of her health remaining or left behinde: then hee hath her naturall phiſicke ready, which is ſtones and faire water: Alſo if he be diſpoſed, he may vſe a little knot of faire white flannell, well, and cleane waſht togeather with them to cleanſe her with all, which flannell although it be vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, yet being wrapt cloſe, it remaines firme in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and being perfectly cleane, returneth againe with the ſtones in the ſame manner, remouing that which is bad, &amp; leauing no cauſe of offence behinde to annoy the <hi>Hawke</hi> withall.</p>
               <p>Now then ſeeing you doe ſufficiently perceiue by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that the pannell which is the ſtomacke of the <hi>Hawke</hi> is thus far ſearcht into, and by the skill and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the <hi>Faulconer</hi> carefullie kept and preſerued, and euery daie curiouſlie cleanſed, what ſhould any ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring doe there where there is no neede: or what effect can it worke vnleſſe to take away her life that would faine liue, if her keeper would ſuffer her:</p>
               <p>For you muſt note that when a ſcouring is giuen, and receiued by the <hi>Hawke</hi> into her body, then by her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat that ſtriues to digeſt it, it is forced to vſe the vertue it hath, and doth drawe vnto it one humor or other, that it hath power ouer: for there is no medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine but it hath a certaine power (according to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the ſimples contained in it) to drawe ſomething
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8778:54"/>
which is contained in the body of the <hi>Hawk.</hi> Now when this is giuen vnto a <hi>Hawke</hi> that is cleane, and hath no corrupt or ſuperfluous humors, vpon which the force, and vigor of it may worke, then muſt it needes exerciſe the ſame vpon the blood &amp; entrails of the <hi>Hawke,</hi> which it doth ſeeke, waſt, and conſume with ſuch vnnaturall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie, that it muſt needs put her whole body out of temper: therefore it is far vnfit to giue vnto your <hi>Hawk</hi> any medicine, vnles it be vpon extremity, and that there be manifeſt ſhew and peoofe of a deſeruing cauſe.</p>
               <p>But now let vs goe a little further to ſee and finde where and how this ſcowring which we giue our <hi>Hawke</hi> ſo often) may paſſe to preuaile better in any other part of the body then it hath done in the <hi>pannell,</hi> or ſtomacke already mentioned. The next admittance, or paſſage it hath from thence is into the ſmall guttes, which place is ordered or diſordered by the ſtomacke, which being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned, and carefully preſerued and kept in health, the other cannot lightly be diſtempered: for both health &amp; ſickneſſe of that part depend vpon the eſtate of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and from thence eſpecially doe grow all other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyances, either vpwards, or downewards: now if the guts bee furred or fraught with droſſe, as with ſuch as we tearme fellanders, or any ſuch like imperfections, I doe allow they may eaſily bee ſcoured forth: but as I haue heard ſome affirme and ſay, that they could not onely giue a medicine to expell them from their places of being: but alſo with the ſame they will preuent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendring or increaſing againe: I am altogeather incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous of it, and do know that no man in the world can maintaine it: for if the ſtomacke be in health, the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells will be cleane and free from any ſuch matter of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, eſpecially in their flying time, when as they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8778:54"/>
be fed cleane, and well ordered in their diet, nor are not clogged, nor cloyed with vnreaſonable gorges, contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if the ſtomacke be imperfect, and that it doe not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and indue well, then muſt needs ſundry euills fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, and ſuch as haue been named, and for curing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with ſcowring it cannot bee, for they will growe and increaſe againe: But you muſt looke backe, and find out not only the Fellanders that are apparantly to be ſeene with the eye, but alſo the originall and principall cauſe, from whence they ſpring and proceede: for if by your iudgement and skill you doe not duely conſider that; if you doe attaine to your deſire, it is more by good lucke then any cunning at al: for the ſtomack is the place (as you haue heard, and may perceiue) that you muſt returne vnto and ſeeke to cure; for it is the coldnes and dulneſſe of that onely, that cauſeth euill and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect digeſture. And although it bee neuer ſo ſound and perfect, yet it may, on the ſodaine, bee dulled and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led diuers wayes: as ſometimes after great toile to giue vnreaſonable gorges; alſo to feede frankely with colde and ſtale meat which her ſtomache abhorreth: Likewiſe, for want of ſtones in due time, to remaine and purge thoſe groſſe humours, which ſhe hath bin ſuffered diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly to retaine for want of them.</p>
               <p>Therefore, to preuent theſe, or ſuch like infirmities before they doe come, you muſt be carefull of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make, to feede it choicely, and to keepe it from any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiance, ſuffering nothing to come there by your good will but ſweet and good meate, and ſuch as the wilde <hi>Haggard</hi> doth take and reſt to prolong her life with all, ſo ſhall you preſerue your <hi>Hawke</hi> from the Fellanders, and all other inwarde diſeaſes that <hi>Hawkes</hi> be moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:8778:55"/>When you doe perceiue that your <hi>Hawke</hi> is ſicke, and mourneth on the Fellanders (for ſo you may terme it verie fitly) ſhe will be of a heauie cheare: and you ſhall alſo confirme the ſame by your owne viewe, in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them in her mutes, to ſhew and appeare in raw and fleſhly threds and ſuch like matter vndigeſted, then is it not fit for you ſo ſoone and raſhlie to intend to ſcoure her, and by that meanes ſeeke to disburden her of them, which will ſodainely after ingender and growe againe. For it is the raſh and haſtie humor of ſome men, that preſſeth them forwatd to vſe ſuch meanes for remedie, as ſerueth but for the preſent time, nor hardly then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but rather by the vnnaturall effects of their ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, their is left behind in the bodie of the <hi>Hawke</hi> ſome vnſauorie annoiance, whereby the ſtomacke is made more vnfit for quicke and perfect digeſture then it was before. Contrariwiſe, if men would but tarrie a time conuenient, of all other diſeaſes the Fellanders would be eaſily cured and ſooneſt rid awaie, which to effect you muſt looke vnto the ſtomacke, and by orderly and clean feede, with the beſt meat you can get, ſeek to cleanſe and make that perfect.</p>
               <p>And faile not euerie night, inſtead of caſting, to giue her halfe a dozen ſmall ſtones out of faire water, which you ſhall finde will ſo worke, and in ſmal time ſo temper the ſtomacke, that it will bee made fit and brought to quicke and good diſgeſture, and the Fellanders will ſoone be rid awaie. Alſo, bee ſure that you feed with good and light meate, ſuch as is eaſie to be digeſted, and let it be hot and the quantie thereof reaſonable.</p>
               <p>And to proue that the Fellanders may be taken away without ſcowring, doe but remember whether the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt <hi>Hawke</hi> in the world will not haue them, while ſhee is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8778:55"/>
in the <hi>Mew,</hi> of which there is no queſtion to be made: for it is moſt certaine that all <hi>Hawkes</hi> of that kind, will haue them with a continuance of rancke and franke feed. And whoſoeuer ſhall obſerue it, may often perceiue ſuch a <hi>Hawke</hi> never ceaſe taking ſtones and going to the water for a month together, beſides keeping of ſparing diet, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but little meat at once vntill ſhee hath purged and cleanſed her body, and bowels againe. Alſo doe but call to minde whether (after her drawing out of the Mew) you haue not perceiued the Fellanders or other reliques of groſe and droſſie ſubſtance will not weare away in due time onely with good meat and ſtones, and a well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red diet, without the aſſiſtance or helpe of any ſcowring or medicine at all.</p>
               <p>All this allowed and well conſidered of, I find no more reaſon why the one part of the <hi>Hawke</hi> ſhould be ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with medicine any more then the other, conſidering they worke no ſuch good effects as ſhould moue vs to vſe them, and that better remedies may be obtained and effected without them.</p>
               <p>Whereas in this laſt diſcourſe (touching the pannell of the <hi>Hawke</hi> which is her very ſtomacke) I haue ſhewed you that the other parts belonging vpwards and downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, are gouerned and kept in health, and likewiſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to infirmity by reaſon of the ſame; which appeareth more plainely by a prerogatiue power, which nature hath beſtowed on it aboue the other parts, by which it is able to make a diuiſion of ſuch mixtures, of things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in kind contained in the ſame, which is either ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by her ſelfe, or giuen vnto her by others; ſuffering the principall ſubſtance to paſſe for the nouriſhment of her body; and with-holding that which is hurtfull, working and drawing it together into a little knot or bundle, very
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8778:56"/>
curiouſly incloſing all things within it, and not leauing ſo much behind as the leaſt feather, corne, or graine of ſeed ſhee taketh into it, all which ſhee then returnes back by caſting it into open view, in which is to be diſcerned the ſignes of health or griefe to enſue.</p>
               <p>Therefore if the ſtomacke of your <hi>Hawke</hi> be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it is ten to one all the parts both vpward and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, will be annoied and grieued by the ſame. If the parts downeward be grieued, you ſhall perceiue it by her mutes in that manner which I haue formerly expreſſed. If the vpper parrs be diſtempered you ſhall perceiue it by her heat appearing in her mouth and throate, which will be more apparant by her ſtirring and flying, and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare and ſhew it ſelfe in white and curdeled froth, which will be drawne into the wind pipe, and cleaue or ſticke to any other place, if it be not corrected in time, before it begin to doe ſo, which may eaſily be done in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which ſhall be ſhewed hereafter.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen you haue a <hi>Hawke</hi> that is ſlow to caſt her ſtones, and will keepe them longer then ſhee ſhould, you muſt be very carefull in her vſage, and eſpecially to keepe her full of fleſh and ſtrong: for as you doe ſeeke to breake her of that bad cuſtome, ſhee will be ſubiect to ſome hard and rough dealing. The cauſe thereof pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds many times of heats taken in their greaſe before they be inſeamed, and preſent cold after it. Alſo at other
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8778:56"/>
times by their bad vſage, and by diuers infirmities inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the bodies of <hi>Hawkes</hi> this ill propertie is caught and cauſed.</p>
               <p>Now for the recouery thereof, you muſt vſe ſtones out of faire water, and them to be giuen at due times and often: But whatſoeuer he is that thinks, by this courſe, to cure his <hi>Hawkes</hi> infirmitie he muſt not giue them in the morning, for if hee doe hee ſhall be conſtrained to tarrie ſo long for the caſting of them, as ſhe will looſe her fleſh with faſting, and hee ſhall be forced to deſiſt from practice, and then will hee be further from his remedie then he was at the firſt And to prouoke her to caſt them by anie meanes, ſpeedily before ſhe is willing, is in vaine, for then you do but hinder and wrong her: for ſhee will ſoone do the like againe, and to practice that courſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten will make an end of her. For the ſtones being kinde and naturall (as euerie man may vnderſtand) there is no <hi>Hawke</hi> will take them her ſelfe but when ſhe hath need: And as ſhe hath need of them, more or leſſe, euen ſo ſhe will keepe and detaine them, for they doe agree with her nature and kinde, and ſhe loues them as may appeare by her taking them her ſelfe, and keeping them ſo long. I doe not perſwade you to giue ſtones to any <hi>Hawke,</hi> that being ſicke, or ill diſpoſed, is thereby ſo weakned, that ſhe is not able to returne them backe from whence ſhee had them (neither will any ſuch <hi>Hawke</hi> of her ſelfe take them) but vnto a ſtrong <hi>Hawke.</hi> And when you do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue her to keepe them as ſhe loues them, and ſomwhat longer then you deſire ſhee ſhould doe, then to content your minde, you do preſently deuiſe to giue her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may compell her by force to caſt them: or it may be you will firſt ſhew her ſome liue or dead thing to prouoke her thereunto, and if that will not ſerue; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8778:57"/>
you may perceiue thereby that ſhee deſires to keep them: yet will you not reſt but aſſaie further with <hi>Selandine,</hi> or ſuch like, to prouoke her to it, which ſhee abhorreth, and the vnnaturall luſt thereof doth ſo much offend her, that ſhee is inforced to caſt vp, as well that which ſhe would haue kept and loued, as that which was contrary to her kind and therefore hated, which courſe is very vnfitting to be held with ſuch a <hi>Hawke,</hi> as you doe finde diſpoſed to keepe her ſtones very long, for it will take no effect with her but onely for the preſent time. Therefore if you will needes vſe it, it were fitter to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to ſuch a <hi>Hawke</hi> as doth caſt orderly, thereby ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to purge her ſelfe of ſuperfluous glut on the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, which you ſuſpected, or may finde her ſtomacke to be cloied withall, through your owne, or others neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or forbearance to giue ſtones.</p>
               <p>But for the other ſlow caſting <hi>Hawke</hi> ſhe will not be cured on the ſodaine, but it muſt be wrought with prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and by degrees. Therfore when you ſhall haue ſuch a <hi>Hawke,</hi> and that you ſhall (notwithſtanding the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell which I haue giuen to the contrarie) reſolue to deale with her from her recouerie in the morning, it is your beſt courſe not to giue her many ſtones at one time; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let them be of the biggeſt, but about eight or nine of the ſmalleſt that Falconers doe vſe to giue their <hi>Hawkes:</hi> and then if ſhe do caſt anie of them within two howres, let her faſt no longer, but feed her on the reſt. Alſo, if ſhe caſt none of them by that time, yet giue her her dinner, and alſo her ſupper at night; yet I haue ſeene a <hi>Hawke</hi> that hath caſt them between her dinner and her ſupper; but howſoeuer, two to one, ſhe will caſt either all or the moſt part of them the next morning, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let her not faſt long before you feed her at any time.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8778:57"/>
And by folowing this courſe, you ſhall finde that in the end it will recouer her, and bring her to caſt in due time. And thus much haue I written for their ſakes that think the night too long, and are wilfully humored to giue ſtones in the morning to ſuch <hi>Hawkes.</hi>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:8778:61"/>
or both infirmities, you muſt omit no time to giue her ſome garlicke at the night time, and vſe her vnto it two or three times in the weeke, and alwaies on the morning miſſe not to proffer her water in a diſh, or porringer, wherein is a ſlice of rubarbe infuſed: and this will moſt aſſuredly cure and amend her: alſo if you doe apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie perceiue that ſhee is troubled with the cold in her head, take a little of the iuice of ſage-leaues being ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and ſtrained, and put into her nares with a ſtraw, and it will amend her in that place: for it is ſpeciall good for the head and braine, and being conuaied into the nares, it draweth downe ſlime and all other corrupt humors out of the head.</p>
               <p>Whereas I haue heretofore ſhewed you how behoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is for euerie <hi>Faulconer,</hi> that as he hath right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and true vnderſtanding of his <hi>Hawkes,</hi> from other mens. So alſo that he ſhould thorough his diligent and due obſeruation learne to be as cunning and skilfull in the diuerſity of their ſundrie natures and diſpoſition, and thereafter to guide and rule them: and alſo for that they are birds ſubiect vnto ſundrie accidents and euils, it is meet they ſhould be as exquiſit and skilfull to know one griefe or ſickneſſe or other infirmitie one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and accordingly to giue and applie by ſundry means a remedie: and not to ſeeme or imitate the order and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the quack-ſaluar or mountibancke, that hath but one poore medicine in his budget, for euery maladie. Therefore as I haue alreadie here ſet downe ſome few ſcowrings, or medicines wholſome, medicinable, and by proofe and experience are tollerable, and fit to be giuen vnto <hi>Hawkes</hi> on iuſt occaſion. I haue alſo ſhewed you the vertue and operation of ſuch ſimples as are contained in them, and will further hereafter, inſtruct you of them particularly, and of euery ones temperature and vertue,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:8778:62"/>
to the end that out of theſe already written, or any other that I ſhall wright hereafter, you may with iudgement &amp; diſcretion eaſily deuide, adde, or take from, whatſoeuer how much or little, and for what griefe ſoeuer to ſerue your turne, and giue inſtruction to thoſe that wants the ſame, according as there ſhall be found and perceiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny needfull occaſion more or leſſe, as touching the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the griefe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſtomack.</note>As for example to ſpeake of the ſtomacke that hath no good appetite to feed, and when it hath fed, cannot diſgeſt well: it is a diſeaſe that may grow diuers waies: therefore it is not poſſible to cure it with one medicine: Alſo if that weaknes of the ſtomack doe come of a weake diſtemperature of it ſelfe onely; then muſt you needes vſe ſome meanes vnto it ſelfe to heat and quicken it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Contrariwiſe ouermuch heat in it ſelfe, may be the cauſe of that weakneſſe; which if it be ſo then will it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare diuers waies, and eſpecially in the mouth and throate; for they will continually be furred with white, and curdeled froath, and her breath will be ſtrong and ſower: Alſo it will be perceiued by the ouer much black and ſanguine colour in her mutes, and burnt caſting, then you muſt of neceſſity coole it with ſome coole thing that is meet for it: But if that weaknes doe grow of any ſuperfluous humor, that doth abound, or hath beene there ingendered; then muſt that humor of neceſſitie be purged, vpward and downeward by ſome gentle medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. Alſo this infirmitie and weakeneſſe of the ſtomacke may grow on extraordinary heat and inflamation of the liuer, which may eaſily be perceiued: for that <hi>Hawke</hi> that is ſicke of that diſeaſe, will hold at one ſtay, and will hardly riſe of her fleſh, but if ſhee doe it, will not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, how well ſoeuer you doe feed: likewiſe ſhee will looke very dullie with her eies, and her caſting will ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or neuer be good, and her mutes will be euermore
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:8778:62"/>
filled with ouer much blacke and other ſignes which I will explaine vnto you more at large, and you finding this, then you muſt haue reſpect onely to that;<note place="margin">The Liuer.</note> eſpecially in her diet, and ſome otherwaies that I ſhall ſhew you hereafter: I could preſcribe you here diuers other waies how this weakeneſſe and decay of the ſtomacke may grow, but let this ſuffice as yet, and approoue that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cured with one medicine, ignorantly giuen.</p>
               <p>As I haue here laſtly a little touched and ſpoken of the liuer, let me returne backe vnto it againe, and giue you further aſſurance that many <hi>Hawkes,</hi> from that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing receiue their deadly wounds, and at ſuch times as it is neuer ſuſpected or thought on: for whereſoeuer it falleth out that your <hi>Hawke</hi> continueth in a diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red kinde of caſting, either of ſtones, or caſting, or both, and that out of your iudgement and owne knowledge, you are aſſured that your beſt meanes by practiſe, with good meat cleane dreſt, caſting and ſtones, and all other good vſage, hath not beene wanting: for remedy of the ſame, then may you be aſſured ſhee is vnſound, and in great danger of death, if it be not ſuddenly ſeene and preuented, and in ſuch a <hi>Hawk</hi> (as I told you before) you ſhall find her mutes commonly to be filled with blacke and ſaguine matter ſeldome diſperſed abroad: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cloddered thicke on lumpes, within the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtirred or remoued, you ſhall find and perceiue a raw and rancke kind of fleſhly ſubſtance: All which impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and ſheweth vnto you that there wants digeſture, and that your <hi>Hawke</hi> hath beene ouer het and ſtrained, as in her flights for want of breath and cleanneſſe, or by vnquietneſſe and toiling on the fiſt, in the time of carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or on ſhipboard with baring and tumbling vp and downe, &amp; ill vſage as they are brought ouer, a matter lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſidered, yet certain it is, that with the ſame, &amp; baſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8778:63"/>
feeding together a number of them are ſurfeted in their bodies, and alſo baned in their liuers, which for want of vnderſtanding in many maſters, the ſeruant is after bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and wrongfully condemned for it, without any cauſe at all: for the lyuer or the diſeaſe thereof, is ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and vnaparant that vnleſſe it bee quite and cleane ſhot and fallen or ſwelled (for that is the truth) with rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennes: and that euery man may diſcerne it by the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his hand, it is neuer miſtruſted nor thought of; when there is no other place within the <hi>Hawke</hi> more, nor ſo much or often infected. Alſo this ſickneſſe and griefe of the lyuer will bee eaſily perceiued, by her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings the which will ſeldome or neuer bee wrapped, or cleane after any of the leaſt large feeding. And, although the lyuer ſo farre as you can perceiue by your ordinary meanes, reſteth right in the place, yet by theſe and ſuch other ſignes as I haue ſhewed it is to be gathered, and you may be aſſured that there lieth her griefe, and that with too much heat and ſtriuing it is infected. And for remedie thereof, and to ſtay the inflammation of the ſame, you muſt ſuddainly hold and keepe her to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate diet and abſtaine from all kinde of hot meates, I meane ſuch as bee hot and ſtrong of diſgeſtion. I doe not forewarne you of the meat hot and new killed, for ſuch you muſt bee ſure to prouide alwayes, and betake you to, and of the cooleſt and eaſieſt to be digeſted, as of hens fleſh, chickens fleſh, yong Pigeons, and of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you can finde to be cooling in operation, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be indured by ſuch a <hi>Hawke</hi> as is perceiued to bee grieued in that place, and through the ſame wants quick digeſture: and with one, or with anie of theſe preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed meates, you muſt not feede euery day, but one daie with one kind, and a little thereof at once, and the next
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8778:63"/>
day with another, and ſo one after another you muſt prouide and giue vnto her, vntill you do perceiue ſhee begins to riſe and mend of her fleſh; and then you muſt not forget to giue caſting and ſtones moderately, and with diſcretion: to the end, that as by this preſcription and courſe of diet, and nouriſhing-feeding, her griefe may bee cured; ſo otherwiſe by her winning and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto her ſelfe glut, and ſuch other like ſuperfluous imperfections of the ſame, naturally increaſing, her health may not be hindered.</p>
               <p>Alſo you muſt be mindfull, and remember to giue your meat with one coole water or other, and ſuch as I ſhal ſet downe, and appoint hereafter to be giuen for the preſeruation of the liuer, and thoſe inward and ſecret parts. Furthermore if you haue rightly obſerued, you may remember that oft times your <hi>Hawkes</hi> liuer will be coloured greene and yellow, when ſhee is dead, which ſheweth that although the ſame were not before percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the higheſt degree to be baned, yet that it were much inflamed as by thoſe colours appeared,<note place="margin">The Gall.</note> which was the ouerflowing of the gall, a diſeaſe that moſt Hawkes are ſubiect vnto; and is as dangerous and deadly as death it ſelfe, if it be not preſent lie foreſeene and cured. This ouerflowing of the gall proceedeth of great heat, taken thorough diſorder and ill vſage, as by toiling flights in greace and vncleanneſſe, or by hanging by the heeles, or tumbling and toſſing, and ſuch other like abuſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the liuer and the ſame infecteth one and other, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the cure muſt be in them both; for that they are both as one ioined together; and how to vnderſtand and know when your Hawke is ſicke of this diſeaſe, you muſt omit no time in the diligent ſearch and view of her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and mutes, whereas in the one, the other or both,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8778:64"/>
that griefe is to be diſcerned: for they will be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally mixed with greene and yellow colour, which will not be (by anie ordinarie meanes) altered or changed, hauing got the vpper hand; but by skilfull and cunning art muſt bee ſtaied and cooled in the beginning, and ſo her life preſerued,</p>

And firſt, he muſt prouide the daintieſt meate that may be gotten, and giue her but a bit at a time, and as often as with conueniency he may, ſtill prouiding change thereof, and as neere as he can let it be of all manner of ſmall birds, for they are meeteſt for that purpoſe, and eaſieſt to be indued and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies may bee prouided warme for her to feede vpon.

               <p>As I haue heretofore ſhewed you how neceſſary it is, that euery Falconer do know what aileth his <hi>Hawk</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe is amiſſe, &amp; certainly what is her diſeaſe: ſo likewiſe ought he to be as skilful to know the vertue &amp; operation of ſuch things as he ſhall giue vnto her, for curing of the ſame. For otherwiſe, he may trauel as a blind man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a guide, and runne on quite contrarie, doing hurt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that the which he intended to doe good vnto: as for example, I haue heard of ſome men that would giue <hi>worme-wood</hi> in a pellet, or knot vnto his <hi>Hawke</hi> at a night with her ſupper, but for what purpoſe I haue not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly vnderſtood, neither will I giue any conſent or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice ſo to do, as to giue it at that time with meate, or any other time on a full gorge, for the nature of it is cleane repugnant and contrary: it is a thing in taſte very bitter and full of iuice, and it cannot chuſe but be offenſiue and diſtaſtefull vnto the <hi>Hawke</hi> in the time of her dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and may cauſe a craſie <hi>Hawke</hi> to caſt before her

               <p>As for example, when you doe find your <hi>Hawkes</hi> mouth and throat to be continually froathy and furred with white, then you may thinke and miſtruſt the ſame to proceed out of the inner parts, and therefore muſt needs be ſaid out of the body: neuertheleſſe as there is ſeuerall places that thorough diſtemperature therein, may ſeeme vpward ſuch and the like annoiance; ſo alſo

you muſt out of your iudgement and skill, vſe ſundrie meanes for remedy as occaſion ſhall ſerue.</p>
               <p>And firſt for the ſtomacke which is the pannell, and is neereſt vnto you, &amp; eaſieſt to be ſearched: to begin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it is therefore moſt meeteſt, and for triall of that place and to be thoroughly reſolued, whether that infirmity of heat ſhewing and appearing in the mouth, doe grow from thence or no, vſe no other thing but ſtones out of faire water morning or euening, as you ſhall find your <hi>Hawke</hi> orderly to caſt them, as if ſhee vſe to ſit long in the morning before ſhee doe caſt, then leaue of that time, and prouide for the night to let her alwaies haue them, and aſſure your ſelfe that in good time they will purge and cleanſe that place of all ſuperfluous heat, or other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that were gathered in the ſame, and the fume and annoiance thereof will be gone, the which will ſhew and be manifeſted in the mouth and throat: for they will be clearely clenſed of the ſame: but if you doe not find this order and meanes to be anſwearable to your expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very ſuddenly; then you may be ſure there is a further and a more dangerous ground and cauſe of the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, which you ought more carefully to looke vnto, and prouide for it another remedy, you may be aſſured it is the liuer that is diſeaſed, and as it is ſeldome or neuer miſtruſted, ſo alſo it is a thing as little or no whit at all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer feared, but certainely in this caſe that muſt needs be the part that is amiſſe; for there are no other places but thoſe two, which prouoke that noiſome and fuming heat to aſcend in that manner vp into the gorge, the throat and mouth. And for the ſtomacke I haue here ſet downe a preſent and ſure meanes with ſtones, and a well ordered diet how to coole and deſtroy it in that place; then of neceſſity it muſt needs depend of the liuer, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8778:71"/>

that through ſuch accidents and diſordered occaſions, yourcoie <hi>Hawkes</hi> may come by the like diſeaſes. And for cure thereof the beſt remedy that euer I could find to be ioined with reſt and eaſe, is the ſpirit of wine, the which you muſt prepare and make in this faſhion. Take halfe a pint of claret wine, or more or leſſe as you ſhall ſee cauſe for the quantity you meane to make, and put it into a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice diſh of ſiluer, if you haue it, or otherwiſe into a diſh of the beſt pewter that you can get, and couer it with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother diſh of equall proportion and bigneſſe very cloſe. Alſo into the ſame you muſt put a little ſugercandy, three or fowre thin ſlices of the whiteſt ginger, as many brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed cloues, and boile all theſe on a chafing-diſh, ouer a ſoft fire, which you muſt keepe with temperate blowing, and now and then take off the vppermoſt diſh, and with a feather ſtrike the moiſture that hangeth theron into ſome thing, wherein you may keepe it ſafe, and alwaies when you doe feede your <hi>Hawke</hi> giue her a little of it with her meate, being ſure to giue her quiet reſt and warmth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and this will recouer her without all doubt; but if ſhe haue taken this diſeaſe before ſhee be inſeamed, then is it ſo much the more dangerous; yet neuertheleſſe if the <hi>Crampe</hi> haue not alſo ioined with it, and ceazed on her and taken away the vſe of her externall parts, ſhe may with good vſage bee recouered and brought to health a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

               <p>As you do boile your wine, you ought to haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

and perſeuerance when the heart and ſpirit thereof doth fade or decay, the which to vnderſtand, is as that do die, ſo the ſtrength thereof ceaſeth to yeeld anie more plentifull ſtore of moiſture, and then you muſt prouide you of new wine and other things to increaſe your ſtore withall. And as this thing is ſpeciall good for any <hi>Hawke</hi> that hath taken this forenamed diſeaſe, by ouerſtriuing, or ſtreining her ſelfe or other misfortune, ſo is it alſo as good to be giuen vnto any ſicke or weake <hi>Hawke</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſtrengthen her withal, and to ſweeten the inward parts after the caſting of the gorge, or any other occaſion that may cauſe the body inwardly and breath to be vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourie: alſo it prouokes appetite, and doth quicken digeſtion.</p>

haue at the Apothecaries, after vi. d or viij d the ounce: and keepe it in a little glaſſe, and when you haue occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to vſe it, put two or three drops in a ſpoone, and at morning and euening rub and chafe it well into the place where the griefe lieth: and when you haue ſo done, moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten a fine linnen cloath in the oyle and wrap about the place, and wet another cloath alſo to keepe it warme and ſuppell: for otherwiſe if it take cold it will not be cured. Alſo, if it fall out that the ſtraine doe happen on any of the tallent or pownce ioints, whereby you doe perceiue that place onely to ſwell, take heed how you do launce or cut it, for that is a very tender and dangerous place to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and amongſt the ſinewes where it may proue a long continued ſore: therefore, when anie ſuch thing doth light on that place, then firſt take your coping yrons and cut that talent to the quicke, and let out a pretty deale of the ranke, and diſtempered blood that otherwiſe would conieale and ſettle in the place and hardly after be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, then haue ſome old knife readie hot in the fire, and ſeare it to ſtay the blood; which done annoint the pained place well with the ſayd oyle of <hi>Excetor,</hi> and wrappe a cloath about it well oyled, then you muſt haue like the finger of a gloue of lether to pull ouer all with the talent out, and ſo make it faſt with a drawing thred, that you may open it and conuaie in a little oyle at the top to keepe it moiſt and ſuppell withal: and ſo let it tarrie on all the weeke, and this oile and this order well obſerued and Kept with warmth and reſt, will cure her for certaine: for this is a very ſpeciall thing to comfort the ſinnewes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and to cure &amp; aſſwage the anguiſh of the ſtraine, and bring it to right perfection againe, as hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten proued,</p>

                     <hi>Cardus Benedictus,</hi> that is to ſay, the bleſſed thiſtle: which for the operation and vertue that God hath giuen vnto it, may well be ſo called; the properties whereof haue beene diligently and carefully gathered out of the <hi>Hearbals</hi> of diuers and ſundry learned writers.</p>
                  <p>This hearbe being very ſmall and finely minced, or ſhred, mingled with ſweet butter and ſugercandie, and now and then giuen in a morning vnto your <hi>Hawke</hi> in a pellet, or pellets; freeth the head of dizines, and purgeth the ſame and whole body of all colde infirmities.</p>
                  <p>The powder thereof alſo now and then giuen in the ſame manner, or cleanly conuayed into a bit of meate, preuenteth the ſame, or driueth it away when it is gotten</p>
                  <p>Alſo, it helpeth the weakeneſſe of the ſtomacke and cauſeth a good appetite to meate, it doth ripe and digeſt tough ſlime or glut that commeth of cold, and bringeth vp that which is in the pannell, ſcowring the ſame of all groſſe humors, and cauſeth to fetch breath more eaſily: it is a ſpeciall thing to preuent the infection that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, or is taken from one <hi>Hawke</hi> vnto another: or after it hath ceaſed or is entered into her body: if ſodainely the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:8778:86"/>
powder be giuen and often while ſhee is ſtrong, it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the poiſon from the very heart: It preſerueth the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, lungs, and all other inward parts of the body: The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled water thereof hath the ſame effects, and waſteth and conſumeth all euil humors, and preſerueth thoſe that be good: and it is ſpeciall good to giue vnto any <hi>Hawke</hi> immediatelie after a blow or bruſe.</p>
                  <p>You may giue this herbe any of theſe waies, and ſhall haue good proofe of their vertues: Firſt in the greene leaues: ſecondly in the powder: thirdly in the iuice: and fourthly in the diſtilled water: and alſo in the licker wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the herbe is boiled: For the moſt part the vertue that is in the one, is in them all: ſo that in diuers diſeaſes for the which the herbe is medicinable: for the lacke of the one, you may vſe the other, and all are ſpeciall preſeruatiues almoſt againſt, all inward and outward diſeaſes, Alſo you muſt vnderſtand that the powder, and water of the herbe is moſt to be regarded, and eſpecially the water: for they may be longeſt kept and preſerued, ſo that you may haue them alwaies in a readineſſe to vſe as need ſhall require: when as you cannot haue the iuice or the greene leaues: and the water which is free from bitterneſſe, may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with meat by it ſelfe alone, for the ſtomacke and taſt will beare it, and like of it as well as of any other ſweet water,</p>
                  <p>As touching the quantitie of it, you neede not be ſo carefull as of other things that doe purge ſtrongly; for in them there is great danger of death in giuing too much, otherwiſe no good done in vſing too little: but in this hearbe it is not ſo, you may vſe your owne diſcretion with reaſonable iudgement and cannot doe amiſſe: And thus much of this hearbe called <hi>Cardus Benedictus,</hi> the which is ſo ſpeciall and powerfull, that it is meete for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Let the powder of the roote mingled with ſome of the diſtilled water be giuen inwardly, and it preſently helpeth.

                  <p>They ſay alſo that the leaues of <hi>Angelica</hi> beaten with the leaues of Rue and hony will cure the bitings of mad dogges, or any other venemous thing, alſo with all ſome of the water wherein the roote and leaues of <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> is boiled muſt be taken, or giuen into the body of either <hi>Hawke,</hi> or whatſoeuer it be that ſhall haue the like misfortune.
